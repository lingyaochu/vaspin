{{TAGDEF| LSFBXC |.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: Removes sources and drains from the exchange-correlation B field.
----

With {{TAG|LSFBXC}}=T, the sources and drains are removed from the exchange-correlation (XC) B field{{cite|sharma:jctc:2018}} at each step of the electronic minimization. Thus, any [[XC functional|XC potential]] can be constrained to correspond to a Maxwellian magnetic field at the cost of becoming a potential-only [[XC functional]], since there is no correction applied to the XC energy.

Moore et al. implemented the same feature in a parallel work{{cite|guy:patch:2024}}{{cite|guy:arxiv:2024}} and performed more extensive applications. Whether the two implementations are identical has not been tested, and no publication is associated with the present implementation (by Marie-Therese Huebsch) using {{TAG|LSFBXC}}.
