Description: {{TAG|LFOCKACE}} determines whether the Adaptively Compressed Exchange Operator is used.{{cite|linlin:jctc:2016}}

*N.B.:Available for CPU and OpenACC version of VASP.6 when compiled with [[Precompiler flags|-Dfock_dblbuf]].
----
For {{TAG|LFOCKACE}}=.TRUE. the Cholesky decomposition <math>X=LL^\dagger</math> of the Fock exchange matrix <math>X_{ij} = \langle \tilde\psi_i \mid \tilde V_X \mid \tilde\psi_j \rangle </math> is calculated and the adaptively compressed exchange operator <math>\tilde V_{ACE} = -\sum_i \mid \tilde X_i \rangle \langle \tilde X_i \mid </math> is used for the action of the Fock exchange on the pseudo orbitals. This method can be used for [[:Category:Hybrid functionals|hybrid functionals]] in combination with the Davidson algorithm ({{TAGBL|ALGO}}=Normal) to save a factor of <math>\approx 3</math> in computation time.

For {{TAG|LFOCKACE}}=.FALSE. the conventional orbital representation is used.

Note: it is good scientific practice to cite the original publication (Ref. {{cite|linlin:jctc:2016}}) if you use this feature. The feature is used by default, if the Davidson algorithm ({{TAG|ALGO}} = Normal) is used; ACE is not used for {{TAG|ALGO}} = Damped or {{TAG|ALGO}} = All.
