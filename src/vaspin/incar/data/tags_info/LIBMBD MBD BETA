{{TAGDEF|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA|[real]|value that was determined for the exchange-correlation functional set with {{TAG|LIBMBD_XC}}}}

Description: {{TAG|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA}} sets the value of the scaling factor <math>\beta</math> (usually denoted <math>s_R</math>) in the many-body methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods{{cite|libmbd_1}}{{cite|libmbd_2}}{{cite|hermann:jcp:2023}}.
----
{{TAG|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA}} allows to choose the value of the damping parameter <math>\beta</math> in the many-body methods as implemented in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods{{cite|libmbd_1}}{{cite|libmbd_2}}{{cite|hermann:jcp:2023}}. The value is internally passed to the libMBD input '''mbd_beta''' described at the page {{cite|libmbd_input}}. {{TAG|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA}} is the same as the {{TAG|VDW_SR}} tag that is used for the VASP implementation of the many-body methods.
{{NB|mind| {{TAG|LIBMBD_MBD_BETA}} can be set only if {{TAG|LIBMBD_XC}}{{=}}none.}}
{{NB|important| This feature is available from VASP.6.4.3 onwards that needs to be compiled with [[Precompiler_options#-DLIBMBD|-DLIBMBD]].}}
libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded{{cite|libmbd_2}} and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding [[Precompiler_options#-DLIBMBD|precompiler options]] and [[Makefile.include#LIBMBD_.28optional.29|links to the libraries]].
