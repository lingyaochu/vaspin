{{TAGDEF|LEPSILON|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LEPSILON}}=.TRUE. determines the static dielectric matrix, ion-clamped piezoelectric tensor, and the Born effective charges using density functional perturbation theory.
----
Determines the static ion-clamped dielectric matrix using density functional perturbation
theory. The dielectric matrix is calculated with and without local field effects. Usually, local field effects are determined on the Hartree level, i.e. including changes of the Hartree potential.
To include microscopic changes of the exchange-correlation potential
the tag {{TAG|LRPA}}=.FALSE. must be set. The method is explained in detail in paper by Gajdoš ''et al.'' {{Cite|gajdos:hummer:2006}} and closely follows the original work of Baroni and Resta {{Cite|baroni:resta:1986}}.
A summation over empty conduction band states is not required, instead the usual expressions in perturbation theory ({{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE.),

:<math>
| \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} |\tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}} \rangle = \sum_{n'\ne n}
\frac{  | \tilde{u}_{n'\mathbf{k}} \rangle  \langle \tilde{u}_{n'\mathbf{k}} |
   \frac{\partial\, (\mathbf{H}(\mathbf k) -\epsilon_{n\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf k))}{ \partial {\mathbf{k}}}
 | \tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}} \rangle }{\epsilon_{n\mathbf{k}}-  \epsilon_{n'\mathbf{k}}},
</math>

are rewritten as linear Sternheimer equations:

:<math>
 \left( \mathbf{H}(\mathbf k) - \epsilon_{n\mathbf k} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf k) \right)
 | \nabla_{\mathbf{k}} \tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}} \rangle  = -
 \frac{\partial  \,(\mathbf{H}(\mathbf k)-  \epsilon_{n\mathbf{k}} \mathbf{S}(\mathbf k)) }
{ \partial {\mathbf{k}}} | \tilde{u}_{n\mathbf{k}} \rangle .
</math>

The solution of this equation involves similar iterative techniques as the conventional selfconsistency cycles. Hence, for each element of the dielectric matrix several lines will be written to the <tt>stdout</tt> and {{FILE|OSZICAR}}. These possess a similar structure as for conventional selfconsistent or non-selfconsistent calculations (a residual minimization scheme is used to solve the linear equation, other schemes such as Davidson do not apply to a linear equation):

It is important to note that exact values for the dielectric matrix are obtained even if only valence band states are calculated. Hence this method does not require increasing the {{TAG|NBANDS}} parameter. The final values for the static dielectric matrix can be found in the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file after the lines
  MICROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR (excluding local field effects)
and
  MACROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR (including local field effects in DFT)
The values found after <tt>MACROSCOPIC STATIC DIELECTRIC TENSOR (excluding local field effects)</tt> should match exactly to the zero frequency values &omega;&rarr;0 determined by the method selected using {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE..
This offers a convenient way to determine how many empty bands are required for
{{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE.. Simply execute VASP using {{TAG|LEPSILON}}=.TRUE. in order to determine the exact values for the dielectric constants. Next, switch to {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE. and increase the number of conduction bands until the same values are obtained using density functional perturbation theory.

Note that the routine also parses and uses the value supplied in the {{TAG|LNABLA}} tag.
Furthermore, the routine calculates the Born effective charge tensor (dynamical charges) and electronic contribution to the piezoelectric tensor,
and prints them after
  BORN EFFECTIVE CHARGES (in e, cumulative output)
and
  PIEZOELECTRIC TENSOR  for field in x, y, z        (C/m^2)
if {{TAG|LRPA}}=.FALSE. is set (the calculated tensors are not sensible in the random phase approximation {{TAG|LRPA}}=.TRUE.). Regarding the piezoelectric tensor, mind the [[ISIF|definition/sign convention of the stress tensor]].


;Pros compared to {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE.
*no conduction bands required.
*local field effects included on the RPA and DFT level (see {{TAG|ACFDT/RPA calculations}}).


;Cons compared to {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE.
*presently only static properties available.
*requires a relatively time consuming iterative process.
*does not support HF or hybrid functionals, whereas {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE. and the GW routines do.


We do not recommend to select {{TAG|LOPTICS}}=.TRUE. and {{TAG|LEPSILON}}=.TRUE.
in a single run (although it might work in some versions).
Density functional perturbation theory {{TAG|LEPSILON}}=.TRUE. does not require to increase {{TAG|NBANDS}} and is, in fact, much slower if  {{TAG|NBANDS}} is increased, whereas the summation over empty conduction band states requires a large number of such states.
