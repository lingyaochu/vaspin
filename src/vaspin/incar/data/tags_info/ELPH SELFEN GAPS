{{DISPLAYTITLE:ELPH_SELFEN_GAPS}}
{{TAGDEF|ELPH_SELFEN_GAPS|[logical]|.false.}}

Description: Find the direct and indirect gaps and the valence and conduction Kohn-Sham states that form it and select to compute their self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
This tag additionally activates the reporting of the value of the band-gap renormalization to the standard output, the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file

  $ grep -A7 'KS-QP gap (meV)' OUTCAR

and the {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} file under

  $ h5ls -r vaspout.h5 | grep gap_renorm
  /results/electron_phonon/electrons/self_energy_1/direct_gap_renorm
  /results/electron_phonon/electrons/self_energy_1/fundamental_gap_renorm`

This output is reported once for each [[Electron-phonon_accumulators | electron-phonon accumulator]].

If instead, the computation of the self-energy for a particular set of states is desired, those can be manually specified using a combination of {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_KPTS}}, {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_IKPT}}, {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_BAND_START}} and {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_BAND_STOP}}.
