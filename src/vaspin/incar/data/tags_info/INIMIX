{{TAGDEF|INIMIX|0 {{!}} 1 {{!}} 2|1}}

Description: Determines the functional form of the initial mixing matrix in the Broyden scheme ({{TAG|IMIX}}=4).
----
The initial mixing matrix might influence the convergence speed for complex situations (especially surfaces and magnetic systems), nevertheless {{TAG|INIMIX}} must not be changed from the default setting: anything which can be done with {{TAG|INIMIX}} can also be done with {{TAG|AMIX}} and {{TAG|BMIX}}, and changing {{TAG|AMIX}} and {{TAG|BMIX}} is definitely preferable.

Possible choices for INIMIX are:

*{{TAG|INIMIX}}=0
:Linear mixing according to the setting of {{TAG|AMIX}}
*{{TAG|INIMIX}}=1
:Kerker mixing (see {{TAG|IMIX}}=1) according to the settings of {{TAG|AMIX}} and {{TAG|BMIX}}.
:The mixed density is given by
::<math>\rho_{\rm mix}\left(G\right)=\rho_{\rm in}\left(G\right)+A \frac{G^2}{G^2+B^2}\Bigl(\rho_{\rm out}\left(G\right)-\rho_{\rm in}\left(G\right)\Bigr)</math>
:with <math>A</math>={{TAG|AMIX}} and <math>B</math>={{TAG|BMIX}}
*{{TAG|INIMIX}}=2
:No mixing (equal to {{TAG|INIMIX}}=0 and {{TAG|AMIX}}=1, not recommended)
