{{TAGDEF|LVDW_ONECELL|[logical][logical][logical]| .FALSE. .FALSE. .FALSE. }}

Description: {{TAGDEF|LVDW_ONECELL}} can be used to disable vdW interaction with mirror image in X Y Z direction. This is advisable for molecular calculations in the gas phase. In all other cases, use the default.

Note: There is some confusing documentation on the ASE pages, which states that ".TRUE. .TRUE. .TRUE." enables the interaction with neighboring cells. However, the opposite is the case and ''.TRUE.'' disables the interaction (".FALSE. .FALSE. .FALSE." = interactions switched on, ".TRUE. .TRUE. .TRUE." = interactions switched off).
