{{TAGDEF|FERWE|[real array]}}

Description: {{TAG|FERWE}} sets the occupancies of the states for {{TAG|ISMEAR}}=-2.
----
To set the occupancies, specify
  {{TAG|FERWE}} = f(1) f(2) f(3) ... f({{TAG|NBANDS}}&times;N<sub>'''k'''</sub>)
The occupancies must be specified for all bands and k points.
The band index runs fastest.
The occupancies must be between 0 and 1.
In the case of spin-polarized calculations ({{TAGO|ISPIN|2}}), {{TAG|FERWE}} sets the occupancies of the states in the up-spin channel.
Specify the occupancies of the states in the down-spin channel by means of the {{TAG|FERDO}} tag.

Note that the partial occupancies are also written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file

Keep in mind that for systems without spin-polarization the occupations are twice as large in the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file than what you should provide for {{TAG|FERWE}} because of spin degeneracy.
{{NB|mind|VASP changes the number of bands {{TAG|NBANDS}} to accommodate your parallel setup. If {{TAG|NBANDS}} is inconsistent with the number of elements you provide with {{TAG|FERWE}} VASP will exit with an error message. The used {{TAG|NBANDS}} is indicated in the error message. Adjust the occupancies provided to {{TAG|FERWE}} to this new value. Alternatively, you can choose an {{TAG|NBANDS}} as the common factor of all your parallel setups to avoid changes in the number of bands (see [[NBANDS#Parallelization|here]]).}}

You can use {{TAG|FERWE}} to keep occupancies fixed during ionic relaxations or molecular dynamics simulations.
However, keeping the orbital occupancies fixed, requires that the orbital order does not change during the self-consistency cycle or during the optimization of the orbitals.
Imagine, for instance, that the eigenenergy of the 65th orbital moves below the orbital energy of the 64th orbital.
By default, VASP will order the eigenenergies so that enforcing {{TAG|FERWE}} will move the electrons to the originally unoccupied 65th orbital because it has now the lower energy.
This problem can be often circumvented by specifying {{TAGO|LDIAG|.FALSE.}} in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.
