{{DISPLAYTITLE:LUSE_VDW}}
{{TAGDEF|LUSE_VDW|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LUSE_VDW}}=.TRUE. switches on the use of a nonlocal vdW-DF functional. These functionals depend on the electron density at two points in space and model long-range van der Waals (dispersion) correlation effects.

{{NB|mind|In versions of VASP prior to 6.4.0, a meta-GGA functional (e.g., SCAN) could be combined only with the rVV10 nonlocal functional. Conversely, a GGA functional could be combined only with the original nonlocal functional of Dion ''et al.''. This restriction is lifted since VASP.6.4.0 thanks to the introduction of the {{TAG|IVDW_NL}} tag.}}
