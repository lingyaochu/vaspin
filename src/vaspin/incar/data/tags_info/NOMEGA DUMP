Description: {{TAG|NOMEGA_DUMP}} selects the imaginary frequency point of screened potential in [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling_GW_algorithms|low-scaling GW calculations]] that is written to file.
{{NB| mind | This tag can be used to obtain {{FILE|WFULLxxxx.tmp}} for [[Bethe-Salpeter-equations_calculations|BSE calculations]].}}

----
{{TAG|NOMEGA_DUMP}} selects the imaginary frequency point of the screened Coulomb kernel that is written to {{FILE|WFULLxxxx.tmp}} in [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling_GW_algorithms|low-scaling GW calculations]].
If set to 0, {{FILE|WFULLxxxx.tmp}} contains the screened Coulomb interaction W at <math>\omega=0</math>.
For positive values, these files contain the screened Coulomb interaction at the corresponding imaginary frequency point.
For negative values, {{FILE|WFULLxxxx.tmp}} is not written.
