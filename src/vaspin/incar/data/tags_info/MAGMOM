Description: Initial magnetic moment for each atom if no magnetization density is present. Considered when symmetry is determined.
----

* For a '''magnetic calculation from scratch''' ({{TAG|ISTART}}=0), {{TAG|MAGMOM}} specifies (i) the initial on-site magnetic moment for each atom, and (ii) lowers the symmetry of the system (as of VASP.4.4.4). A magnetic calculation could be either a spin-polarized calculation ({{TAG|ISPIN}}=2) or noncollinear calculation ({{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}}=T). If the {{TAG|MAGMOM}} line breaks a symmetry of the crystal, the corresponding symmetry operation is removed and not applied during the symmetrization of, e.g., charges and forces.

* When '''restarting a magnetic calculation''', {{TAG|MAGMOM}} is only used to determine the symmetry of the system and not to set the on-site magnetic moment. Therefore, if you remove the {{TAG|MAGMOM}} tag before restarting from a converged {{FILE|WAVECAR}} or {{FILE|CHGCAR}}, the magnetization is likely to be symmetrized away.

* {{TAG|MAGMOM}} also specifies the initial on-site magnetic moments when a '''magnetic calculation''' ({{TAG|ISPIN}}=2 or {{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}}=T) is '''started from a non-spin-polarized calculation''' ({{TAG|ISPIN}}=1 and {{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}}=F). This implies restarting with {{TAG|ICHARG}}=1 while the {{TAG|CHGCAR}} file contains no magnetization density. Starting magnetic calculations from a non-spin-polarized calculation can improve convergence.
The {{TAG|I_CONSTRAINED_M}} tag can constrain the on-site magnetic moments.
{{NB|tip|To converge to the magnetic ground state, we recommend setting the magnetic moments slightly larger than the expected values, e.g., using the experimental magnetic moment multiplied by 1.2-1.5. A growing collection of experimental data is available at the Bilbao crystallographic server.{{Cite|bilbao.crystal.server}} If no experimental data is available, {{TAG|MAGMOM}} can be defined according to the procedure outlined in the Huebsch et al. 2021.{{Cite|huebsch:prx:11}}|}}
{{NB|important|The final magnetic state strongly depends on the initial values for {{TAG|MAGMOM}}.{{Cite|huebsch:prx:11}} This is true even if no symmetry is used ({{TAG|ISYM}}{{=}}-1), because of the many local minima that most exchange-correlation functionals have within spin-density-functional theory.|}}
== Format and basis ==

* For a spin-polarized calculation ({{TAG|ISPIN}}=2), {{TAG|MAGMOM}} is a list of NIONS positive or negative values that specify the magnitude and relative orientation of the magnetization on each ion. The on-site magnetic moments have no direction in real space, i.e., no orientation in the lattice.

* For noncollinear calculation ({{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}}=T), the on-site magnetic moment is specified by three components for each ion. Without spin-orbit coupling ({{TAG|LSORBIT}}=False), the total energy depends only on the relative direction of the on-site magnetic moments. Hence, you can give the desired magnetic structure in Cartesian coordinates without considering how the lattice matrix or {{TAG|SAXIS}} is defined.

* With spin-orbit coupling ({{TAG|LSORBIT}}=True), the three components must be specified in the basis of spinor space that is defined by {{TAG|SAXIS}}. The default is  <math>\sigma_1=\hat x</math>, <math>\sigma_2 =\hat y</math>, <math>\sigma_3 = \hat z</math>, such that {{TAG|MAGMOM}} can be given in Cartesian coordinates. The orientation of {{TAG|MAGMOM}} with respect to the lattice only matters if spin-orbit coupling is included ({{TAG|LSORBIT}}).

== Examples ==

* The most simple input for a bcc cell with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignment would be the following.

:{{TAG|POSCAR}} file:
 AFM
  2.80000
  1.00000   .00000   .00000
   .00000  1.00000   .00000
   .00000   .00000  1.00000
  1 1
 Cartesian
   .00000   .00000   .00000
   .50000   .50000   .50000
:with
  {{TAG|ISPIN}} = 2
  {{TAG|MAGMOM}} = 1.0 -1.0
:specified in {{FILE|INCAR}}. In a perfectly AFM ordered cell, the total net magnetisation is zero, but the local magnetic moments can be written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file by setting {{TAG|LORBIT}} tag (and if {{TAG|LORBIT}}<10 , the {{TAG|RWIGS}} tag in addition) in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.

* If you have problems converging to a desired magnetic solution, try to calculate first the non-magnetic ground state and continue from the generated {{TAG|WAVECAR}} and {{TAG|CHGCAR}}. To restart, e.g., a calculation with two atoms that have equally large and antiferromagnetically coupled on-site magnetic moments, you need to set the following in the {{TAG|INCAR}} file:
 {{TAG|ICHARG}} = 1
 {{TAG|ISPIN}} = 2
 {{TAG|MAGMOM}} = m -m
:or for a noncollinear
 {{TAG|ICHARG}} = 1
 {{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}} = T
 {{TAG|MAGMOM}} = 0 0 m  0 0 -m

* For systems containing many atoms, {{TAG|MAGMOM}} input on a single line can be hard to read, especially in the noncollinear case. It is possible to provide {{TAG|INCAR}} input on [[INCAR#Format|multiple lines]] using backslashes ('''\''') as linebreaks. E.g. for a noncollinear system with AFM alignment and 16 atoms (the first 8 of them magnetic), the multi-line input could look like this:
 {{TAG|MAGMOM}} =  3.0  2.0  1.0 \
          -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 \
           3.0  2.0  1.0 \
          -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 \
           3.0  2.0  1.0 \
          -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 \
           3.0  2.0  1.0 \
          -3.0 -2.0 -1.0 \
           24*0.0
