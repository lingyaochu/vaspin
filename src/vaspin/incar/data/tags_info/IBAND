{{TAGDEF|IBAND|[integer array]|not set}}

Description: {{TAG|IBAND}} sets a list of bands that contribute to calculating the [[Band-decomposed charge densities|partial charge density]].
----
{{TAG|IBAND}} selects a subset of bands for which the partial charge density is calculated when {{TAG|LPARD}} = .TRUE..
Partial charge densities are written to the {{FILE|PARCHG}} file, or one of its variants, depending on the setting of {{TAG|LSEPB}} and {{TAG|LSEPK}}.
<!--If {{TAG|LPARDH5}} = .TRUE. the output will be redirected to the {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} [[Makefile.include#HDF5_support_(strongly_recommended)|hdf5]] file.-->
{{NB|mind|Setting {{TAG|IBAND}} will automatically set {{TAG|NBMOD}} {{=}} N, where N is the number of bands passed to {{TAG|IBAND}}, regardless of the {{TAG|NBMOD}} setting in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.}}
E.g. if
<code>IBAND = 20 21 22 23 45</code>
the charge density will be calculated for the four bands 20 to 23 and band 45, and {{TAG|NBMOD}} will be set to 5.
