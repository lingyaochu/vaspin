{{TAGDEF|LPARDH5|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LPARDH5}} determines whether the partial charges are written to {{FILE|PARCHG}} or {{FILE|vaspout.h5}}.
{{Available|6.5.0}}
----
[[Band-decomposed charge densities|Partial charges]] can be calculated as a postprocessing step when {{TAG|LPARD}} = .TRUE.. The output is written to one or several {{FILE|PARCHG}} files if {{TAG|LPARDH5}}=.FALSE., and to {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} if {{TAG|LPARDH5}}=.TRUE.. If {{TAG|NBMOD}} = -1, the setting of {{TAG|LPARD}} is irrelevant. Instead of a {{FILE|PARCHG}} file, or a partial_charges group in the {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} hdf5 file, a {{FILE|CHGCAR}} file ''without'' augmentation charges will be written.

If the output is redirected to {{FILE|vaspout.h5}}, {{py4vasp}} can be used to analyze the partial charge density and to simulate STM pictures.
