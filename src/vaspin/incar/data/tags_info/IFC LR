{{TAGDEF|IFC_LR|[integer]|1}}

Description: Controls the treatment of the long-range part of the interatomic force constants during electron-phonon calculations.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

This tag controls the treatment of the [[Phonons:_Theory#Long-range_interatomic_force_constants_.28LO-TO_splitting.29|long-range electrostatic contributions to the interatomic force constants (IFC)]] arising in polar dielectric materials.
{{TAGO|IFC_LR|1}} has the same effect as {{TAGO|LPHON_POLAR|True}} but is used in the context of electron-phonon interactions.
{{NB|mind|In this case, the required Born effective charges and dielectric tensor are read from the {{FILE|phelel_params.hdf5}} file.}}

== Modes ==

;{{TAGO|IFC_LR|0|op=≤}}
:No long-range correction scheme is applied to the IFC matrix. This is most likely very inaccurate for semiconductors and insulators with non-vanishing Born effective charge.
;{{TAGO|IFC_LR|1}}
:Dipole corrections are applied to the IFC matrix.
