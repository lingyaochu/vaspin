{{TAGDEF|IBSE|0 {{!}} 1 {{!}} 2 {{!}} 3 |2}}

Description: {{TAG|IBSE}} can be used to select the algorithm for solving the Bethe-Salpeter or Casida equation.
----
The following options are available to solve the Bethe-Salpeter or Casida equation:
*{{TAG|IBSE}} = 0: [[Bethe-Salpeter equations#Exact diagonalization|Exact diagonalization with old BSE driver]]
*{{TAG|IBSE}} = 1: [[Bethe-Salpeter equations#Time evolution|Time evolution]]
*{{TAG|IBSE}} = 2: [[Bethe-Salpeter equations#Exact diagonalization| Exact diagonalization]]
*{{TAG|IBSE}} = 3: [[Bethe-Salpeter equations#Lanczos algorithm|Lanczos algorithm]]

{{TAGO|IBSE|2}} and {{TAGO|IBSE|0}} yield exactly the same results but the old driver ({{TAGO|IBSE|0}}) is typically much slower and will be deprecated in the future.
{{NB|mind| {{TAGO|IBSE|2}} and {{TAGO|IBSE|3}} are only available for VASP version 6.5.0 and above.}}
