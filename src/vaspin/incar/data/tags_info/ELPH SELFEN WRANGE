----

The electron self-energy, <math>\Sigma_{n \mathbf{k}}(\omega)</math>, depends on the frequency <math>\omega</math> (or energy <math>\hbar \omega</math>).
The tag {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_WRANGE}} determines the width of the energy window in which to evaluate the self-energy.
However, the location and width of the energy window is also influenced by the sign of {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_NW}}.
For more information, we refer to the documentation of {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_NW}}.
