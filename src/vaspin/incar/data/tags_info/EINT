{{TAGDEF|EINT| [real1] [real2] {{!}} [real1] | not set}}

Description: {{TAG|EINT}} sets the energy interval for bands contributing to the calculation of the [[Band-decomposed charge densities|partial charge density]] in eV.
----
*{{TAG|EINT}}= [real1] [real2]:
:If two values are given, the energy interval between those values is used.
*{{TAG|EINT}}= [real1]:
:If only one value is given, the Fermi energy <math>\epsilon_f</math> is used as the other limit [real2] of the interval.
----
{{NB| important | The energies passed in {{TAG|EINT}} are used as set if {{TAG|NBMOD}} {{=}} -2, but will be added to the Fermi energy (<math>\epsilon_f</math> + real1 and <math>\epsilon_f</math> + real2) if {{TAG|NBMOD}} {{=}} -3.}}
If [real1] is larger than [real2], the two values will be flipped internally, so a meaningful energy interval is used.

If {{TAG|EINT}} is set, but {{TAG|NBMOD}} is not, it will be internally set to {{TAG|NBMOD}} = -2, and the input values of {{TAG|EINT}} will be treated as absolute energies.

{{TAG|EINT}} can be conveniently used in combination with {{TAG|NBMOD}} = -3 to mimic the bias-voltage for [[STM_of_graphene|simulating a scanning-tunneling-microscope image]].
