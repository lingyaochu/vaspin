Description: {{TAG|IWAVPR}} determines how orbitals and/or charge densities
are extrapolated from one ionic configuration to the next configuration.

----

For {{TAG|IWAVPR}}<10, the file {{TAG|TMPCAR}} is used to store old orbitals that
are required for the prediction. This setting is depreciated, and not supported by the MPI version.
The recommended settings are {{TAG|IWAVPR}}>10. In this case, the prediction is
performed without an external file {{TAG|TMPCAR}} (i.e. all required arrays
are stored in the main memory).

The following options are available for {{TAG|IWAVPR}}:
*{{TAG|IWAVPR}}=0 no extrapolation, usually not preferable for first-principles molecular dynamics simulations or relaxations of the ions into the groundstate.
*{{TAG|IWAVPR}}=1|11 Simple extrapolation of the charge density using atomic charge densities (eq. (9.8) in thesis G. Kresse). This switch is convenient for geometry optimizations (ionic relaxation and volume/cell shape with the conjugate gradient or Quasi-Newton methods, i.e. {{TAG|IBRION}}=1,2,3 etc.)
*{{TAG|IWAVPR}}=2|12 A second-order extrapolation for the orbitals and the charge density (eq. (9.9) in thesis G. Kresse) is performed. This results in superior performance for first-principles molecular-dynamics simulations. It might cause instabilities during on-the-fly learning, so the default is 11 in this case.

<!--However, the following warning may occur: <code>Information: wavefunction orthogonal band xxx..</code>. This is a sign of band crossing and -->
*{{TAG|IWAVPR}}=3|13 In this case a second-order extrapolation for the orbitals, and a simple extrapolation of the charge density using atomic charge densities is done. This is a mixture between {{TAG|IWAVPR}}=1 and 2, however, it is usually worse than {{TAG|IWAVPR}}=2.
:Mind: We don't encourage this setting.
