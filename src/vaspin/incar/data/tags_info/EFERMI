{{TAGDEF|EFERMI|MIDGAP {{!}} LEGACY {{!}} [real]|LEGACY}}

Description: Defines how the Fermi energy is calculated in VASP. It is recommended to use EFERMI = MIDGAP.

== Fermi energy in semiconductors ==

For semiconducting materials, the Fermi energy is not uniquely defined in the bandgap of the material.
Any value that produces the correct number of electrons ({{TAG|NELECT}}) is allowed.
By default, VASP places the Fermi energy at a somewhat arbitrary value within the bandgap.
The precise value depends on values chosen for the smearing ({{TAG|ISMEAR}} and {{TAG|SIGMA}}) and the density of states ({{TAG|EMIN}}, {{TAG|EMAX}}, and {{TAG|NEDOS}}).
Typically, this places the Fermi energy towards the bottom of the bandgap.

You can change this behavior by setting {{TAG|EFERMI}} = MIDGAP (recommended).
VASP will then put the Fermi energy in the middle of the gap because this is the most consistent with increasing the smearing {{TAG|SIGMA}}.
This algorithm to determine the Fermi energy was introduced in VASP.6.4.
The value of the Fermi energy should not affect the outcome of the calculation.

== Fermi energy in metals ==

MIDGAP and LEGACY should yield the same value when your system does not have a gap.
The Fermi energy is placed precisely at the value so that underneath are enough states to accommodate {{TAG|NELECT}} electrons. The evaluation of the Fermi energy involves an integral over the 1. BZ.
Therefore, the Fermi energy in metals needs to be converged with respect to the {{FILE|KPOINTS}} mesh and smearing ({{TAG|ISMEAR}}, {{TAG|SIGMA}}).
{{NB|tip| If you are interested in the properties at the Fermi energy (e.g., for transport calculations), you should compute the Fermi energy with a very dense '''k'''-point mesh. To save computational time, you can fix the charge density ({{TAG|ICHARG}} {{=}} 11) once the Kohn-Sham states have converged with respect to the '''k'''-point density and increase the number of '''k'''-point further to converge the value of the Fermi energy.}}
== Fixed Fermi energy ==
Occasionally, you want to compute systems with fixed Fermi energy for a given charge density.
To this end, set {{TAG|EFERMI}} to a numeric value and {{TAG|ICHARG}} = 11.
A possible use case is to set {{TAG|EFERMI}} to the converged Fermi energy in a band-structure calculation.
You may use this to introduce electron doping/depletion to a system.
{{NB|warning|The Fermi energy cannot be computed based on '''k''' points along a path.}}
This is, in particular, important for band-structure calculation of metallic systems because for gaped systems the Fermi energy often still ends up at a valid value within the gap despite the inaccurate computation. Hence, to plot a band structure the band energies should be taken from the calculation with fixed charge density based on '''k'''-points along a path, but the Fermi energy should be taken from the calculation based on a '''k''' mesh (e.g., the scf calculation by which the charge density was obtained or a more precisely converged Fermi energy based on the same fixed charge density). {{TAG|EFERMI}} can fix the Fermi energy to the proper value during the band-structure calculation.
