Description: Reciprocal space cutoff for the treatment of the long-range contribution.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

Similar to the [[Phonons:_Theory#Long-range_interatomic_force_constants_(LO-TO_splitting)|treatment of the long-range part of the force-constants]], the potential and the PAW strengths also require a special treatment{{cite|engel:prb:2022}} in polar materials.
The correction scheme involves an Ewald summation over reciprocal lattice vectors that converges rapidly in reciprocal space.
{{TAG|ENCUTLR}} controls the number of G-vectors included in the Ewald sum in the same way as {{TAG|ENCUT}} controls the number of G-vectors (plane-wave components) of the electronic Kohn-Sham orbitals.
