{{TAGDEF|LDAUPRINT|0 {{!}} 1|0}}

Description: {{TAG|LDAUPRINT}} controls the verbosity of a DFT+U calculation.
----
*{{TAG|LDAUPRINT}}=0: No onsite occupancy matrix is written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file.
*{{TAG|LDAUPRINT}}=1: The spin up and spin down onsite occupancy matrices of the atoms types to which a <math>U</math> is applied are written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file at each iteration (below "onsite density matrix"). The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the total (spin up + spin down) onsite matrix is also written (below "occupancies and eigenvectors").
<!--
*{{TAG|LDAUPRINT}}=2: same as {{TAG|LDAUPRINT}}=1, plus potential matrix dumped to {{FILE|stdout}}.
