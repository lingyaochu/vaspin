Description: List of temperatures for which to compute the electron self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

This list of temperatures is used to determine the chemical potential, the occupation factors entering the electron self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling as well as the transport coefficients in the context of a [[Transport_coefficients_including_electron-phonon_scattering|transport calculation]].

The chemical potential is determined for the list of temperatures {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_TEMPS}} and carrier concentrations specified by
{{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_CARRIER_DEN}} or {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_CARRIER_PER_CELL}}. Alternatively, one can specify the chemical potential and determine the carrier concentration using {{TAG|ELPH_SELFEN_MU}}.
