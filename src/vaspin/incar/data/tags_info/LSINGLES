Description: Switch on singles contribution to correlation energy for [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling_GW_algorithms|GW algorithms]].{{cite|klimes:jcp:143}}
----
{{TAG|LSINGLES}} enables the calculation of the singles contributions to the correlation energy that can be represented by the following Feynman (time-ordered) diagrams:{{cite|kaltak:thesis2015}}{{cite|klimes:jcp:143}}

[[File:SinglesDiagrams.png|320px]]

{{TAG|LSINGLES}} is used in combination with the [[ACFDT/RPA_calculations#Low-scaling_ACFDT.2FRPA_algorithm|low-scaling ACFDT/RPA]] and [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling_GW_algorithms|GW]] algorithms.

If the [[ACFDT/RPA_calculations#All-in-one_approach_to_calculate_ACFDT-RPA_total_energy|ACFDT/RPA algorithm]] is selected with {{TAG|ALGO}}=RPAR|ACFDTR and {{TAGBL|LSINGLES}} is set, the code calculates two singles contributions and writes following lines to {{FILE|OUTCAR}}

 HF single shot energy change        -1.23182672
 renormalized HF singles             -1.23310555

Here, '''renomalized HF singles''' corresponds to the renormalized singles contribution suggested by Ren and coworkers:{{cite|ren:prb:88}}

<math>
E^{rSE}_c = -\sum_{a\in virt, i\in occ} \frac{|\langle i| V^{HF} - V_0^{KS}|a\rangle|^2 }{\epsilon_a-\epsilon_i}
</math>

This contribution accounts for the change of the mean-field exchange energy and can be derived consistently within the AC-FDT framework as described in Sec. II D Eq. (28) of Klimeš et al.{{cite|klimes:jcp:143}}

In contrast, the '''HF single shot energy change''' line contains the somewhat simpler contribution{{cite|klimes:jcp:143}}

<math>
E_c^{rSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left[ (\gamma_{HF} - \gamma_{DFT})\hat h_{HF} \right],
</math>

where <math>\gamma_{HF}</math> is the Hartree-Fock density matrix, determined for the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian <math>\hat h_{HF}</math> and <math>\gamma_{DFT}</math> is the Kohn-Sham density matrix.
In all practical calculations, we found that both values, the single-shot HF and renormalized singles contributions, are exceedingly close to each other.

If the [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling.2C_single_shot_GW_calculations:_G0W0R|GW algorithm]] is selected with {{TAG|ALGO}}=G0W0R, the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} contains also the singles contribution beyond the Hartree-Fock level

<math>
E_c^{GWSE} = \mathrm{Tr}\left[ (\gamma_{RPA} - \gamma_{DFT})\hat h_{HF} \right],
</math>

where <math>\gamma_{RPA}</math> is the RPA density matrix.{{cite|klimes:jcp:143}}
For versions <= 6.4.2, this contribution is not directly printed to file. However, the first and second term is printed to {{FILE|OUTCAR}}:

Version >6.4.2 writes the GWSE singles contribution to {{FILE|OUTCAR}}:
  GWSE singles contribution:        -1.07080625
{{NB|mind|The singles contribution is calculated correctly only for the default {{TAG|NATURALO}}{{=}}2.}}
The [[ACFDT/RPA calculations#Output of low-scaling ACFDT.2FRPA|ACFDT total energy]] in the limit of [[ACFDT/RPA calculations#Basis set convergence|infinite energy cutoff]] is then obtained by adding the singles contribution to the value of

<code>HF+E_corr(extrapolated)    =      -153.98810072 eV</code>
