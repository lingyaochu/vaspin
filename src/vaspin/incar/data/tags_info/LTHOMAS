{{TAGDEF|LTHOMAS|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LTHOMAS}} selects a decomposition of the exchange functional based on Thomas-Fermi exponential screening.
----
If {{TAG|LTHOMAS}}=.TRUE. the decomposition of the exchange operator (in a [[Hybrid functionals: formalism|range-separated hybrid functional]]) into a short range and a long range part will be based on Thomas-Fermi exponential screening.
The Thomas-Fermi screening length ''k''<sub>TF</sub> is specified by means of the {{TAG|HFSCREEN}} tag.

For typical semiconductors, a Thomas-Fermi screening length of about 1.8 &Aring;<sup>-1</sup> yields reasonable band gaps. In principle, however, the Thomas-Fermi screening length depends on the valence electron density; VASP determines this parameter from the number of valence electrons (read from the {{FILE|POTCAR}} file) and the volume and writes the corresponding value to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file:
  Thomas-Fermi vector in A             =   2.00000
{{NB|mind|If {{TAG|LTHOMAS}}{{=}}.TRUE., then {{TAG|LHFCALC}}{{=}}.TRUE. is automatically set.}}
Since, VASP counts the semi-core states and ''d''-states as valence electrons, although these states do not contribute to the screening, the values reported by VASP are often incorrect.
