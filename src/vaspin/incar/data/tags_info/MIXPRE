Description: {{TAG|MIXPRE}} specifies the metric in the Broyden mixing scheme({{TAG|IMIX}}=4).
----
*{{TAG|MIXPRE}}=0
:No preconditioning, metric=1
*{{TAG|MIXPRE}}=1
:"Inverse Kerker" metric with automatically determined {{TAG|BMIX}} (determined in such a way that the variation of the preconditioning weights covers a range of a factor 20)
*{{TAG|MIXPRE}}=2
:"Inverse Kerker" metric with automatically determined {{TAG|BMIX}} (determined in such a way that the variation of the preconditioning weights covers a range of a factor 200)
*{{TAG|MIXPRE}}=3 (implemented for test purposes; '''not''' recommended)
:"Inverse Kerker" metric with {{TAG|BMIX}} from {{FILE|INCAR}}, the weights for the metric are given by
::<math>P\left(G\right)=1+\frac{B^2}{G^2}</math>
:with <math>B</math>={{TAG|BMIX}}.

The preconditioning is done only on the total charge density (i.e. up+down component) and not on the magnetization charge density (i.e. up-down component). In our experience, the introduction of a metric always improves the convergence speed. The best choice is {{TAG|MIXPRE}}=1 (i.e. the default).
