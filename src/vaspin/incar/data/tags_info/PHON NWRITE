Description: {{TAG|PHON_NWRITE}}
determines how much output is written to the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file when computing the phonon dispersion {{TAG|LPHON_DISPERSION}}=.TRUE.

----

Positive numbers mean human-readable output, and negative numbers mean one-line format. The available options are:

! PHON_NWRITE !! Description
|-
|  2 || For each q point, write the same as 1 and then the phonon modes with the displacement of each atom in the three cartesian directions per line.
|-
|  1 || For each q point, q-point coordinates are written in one line and the phonon frequencies are written one branch per line in different units.
|-
|  0 || No phonon output is written to OUTCAR.
|-
| -1 || For each q point, only a single line is written containing q-point coordinates and frequencies.
|-
| -2 || For each q point, q-point coordinates and frequencies are written in separate blocks and frequencies are reported in different units.
|-
| -3 || Like -2, but in addition, the phonon eigenvectors are written for each q point.
