{{TAGDEF|LPHON_POLAR|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LPHON_POLAR}} includes dipole-dipole corrections in the computation of the phonon dispersion. For this mode, {{TAG|PHON_DIELECTRIC}} and {{TAG|PHON_BORN_CHARGES}} must also be set.
----

If the material is non-metallic and polar (i.e. two or more atoms in the unit cell carry nonzero Born effective charge tensors), a special treatment of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction is required to obtain a smooth phonon dispersion.
This is activated by setting {{TAG|LPHON_POLAR}}=.TRUE. and supplying the static dielectric tensor ({{TAG|PHON_DIELECTRIC}}) and the Born-effective charges ({{TAG|PHON_BORN_CHARGES}}) which can be obtained in a separate VASP calculation using the {{TAG|LEPSILON}} or {{TAG|LCALCEPS}} tag.
The dipole-dipole part of the interatomic force-constants is evaluated using an Ewald summation with the number of <math>\mathbf{G}</math> vectors determined by the cutoff length ({{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}}).

In the case of metals, the dielectric function is infinite, for nonpolar semiconductors the Born effective charges are zero which in both cases means that the [[Phonons:_Theory#Long-range_interatomic_force_constants_.28LO-TO_splitting.29|long-range interatomic force-constants]] are zero and this dipole-dipole correction does not need to be applied.
