{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_OUTPUT_MODE}}
{{DEF|ML_OUTPUT_MODE|0|if {{TAGO|ML_MODE|run}}|1|else}}

Description: This tag allows to disable certain file output which helps to increase performance in molecular-dynamics simulations with machine-learned force fields in prediction-only mode ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|run}}).
{{NB|mind|This tag is only available as of VASP.6.4.0.}}
----
This tag is useful in combination with {{TAG|ML_OUTBLOCK}} to further reduce per-time-step calculations and file output. The following options exist for this tag:
*{{TAGO|ML_OUTPUT_MODE|1}}: '''Normal operation''', output is written as usual in ab-initio molecular-dynamics simulations.
*{{TAGO|ML_OUTPUT_MODE|0}}: '''Reduced file output mode''', in contrast to normal operation the following changes apply:
** Pair-correlation functions are not computed.
** No output to {{FILE|PCDAT}} file.
** No <code>pair_correlation</code> output section in {{FILE|vaspout.h5}}.
** No <code>structure</code>, <code>varray name="forces"</code> and <code>varray name="stress"</code> output sections in {{FILE|vasprun.xml}}.
