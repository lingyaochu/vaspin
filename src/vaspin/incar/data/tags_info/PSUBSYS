{{TAGDEF|PSUBSYS|[real array]}}

Description: {{TAG|PSUBSYS}} sets the collision probabilities for the atoms in each atomic subsystem in calculations with multiple Anderson thermostats (in case VASP was compiled with [[Precompiler_flags|-Dtbdyn]]).
----
Up to three user-defined atomic subsystems may be coupled with independent Andersen thermostats<ref name="Andersen80"/> ({{TAG|MDALGO}}=13).

The collision probabilities for the atoms in each atomic subsystem is set by means of the {{TAG|PSUBSYS}} tag (one has to specify one number for each subsystem).
