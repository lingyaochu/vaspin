{{DEF|LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS|.FALSE.|}}

Description: {{TAG|LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS}} read the force constants from a vaspin.h5 file containing the force constants computed with a previous VASP run.

----

After the computation of the force constants using finite-differences ({{TAG|IBRION}}=5,6) or density-functional perturbation theory ({{TAG|IBRION}}=7,8) on a supercell the force constants are written to the vaspout.h5 file.
To plot the phonon dispersion on a different path the user can modify the {{FILE|QPOINTS}} file and read the force constants computed previously (i.e. without performing the finite-differences computations on supercells again).
To do so copy vaspout.h5 to vaspin.h5 and set {{TAG|LPHON_READ_FORCE_CONSTANTS}}=.TRUE. in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.
Note that when this is set only the phonon dispersion is performed and then VASP quits without running any additional calculation specified in the {{TAG|INCAR}} file.
{{NB|mind| Only available as of VASP 6.4.0.}}
