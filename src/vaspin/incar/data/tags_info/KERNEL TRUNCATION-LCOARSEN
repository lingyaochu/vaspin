{{TAGDEF|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LCOARSEN| .True. {{!}} .False.|.True.}}

Description: {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LCOARSEN}} speeds up computation of the local potential in the kernel truncation method by coarsening the charge density before padding it
----

Kernel truncation methods pad the computational cell with vacuum.
This padded cell is expensive to compute due to FFTs being performed on a larger grid.
The {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LCOARSEN}} method selectively replaces the long range potential with the truncated potential instead of computing the entire potential on a padded grid.
This selective replacement of the potential bypasses the need for padding, speeding up the computation of the kernel truncation methods.
{{NB|mind|IF {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE}} is switched off, all other KERNEL_TRUNCATION tags, i.e. {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/IDIMENSIONALITY}}, {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LCOARSEN}}, and {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/ISURFACE}} will be ignored.}}
