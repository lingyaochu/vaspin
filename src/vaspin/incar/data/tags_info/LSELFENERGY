:To print the self-energy is a slight extra computational effort since, within the GW algorithms, the self-energy is usually just evaluated near KS eigenenergies <math>\epsilon_{nk}</math> and not the entire frequency range.
{{NB|mind|In quartic-scaling GW the self-energy is given on the real-frequency axis, while for low-scaling GW the self-energy is given on the imaginary-frequency axis.|:}}

== Format ==

=== Real frequencies ===

If '''quartic-scaling GW algorithms''' are selected, e.g. {{TAG|ALGO}}=EVGW0, the first column corresponds to points on the real-frequency axis (in eV). The second and third columns are the real and imaginary parts of the self-energy (in eV) at a given band index and '''k''' point. To identify the band index and '''k''' point, the ordering has to be taken from the {{FILE|OUTCAR}}: Instead of the QP shifts, a small set of self-energy points are printed to {{FILE|OUTCAR}}, similar to the following output
 calculating selfenergy CALC_SELFENERGY_LINEAR between w=-150.00 150.00

 k-point   1 :       0.0000    0.0000    0.0000

  -144.0000000   -24.1803224     0.2537669
  ...
   147.0000000   -20.3498375    -2.8348252
   150.0000000   -20.2310127    -2.7491028

  -144.0000000   -13.1030584     0.2520593
  ...

Here, the first and second band at the Gamma point are printed.
The line with <code>selfenergy along real axis</code> contains band No., the KS energy, and the occupation of this state.
The output in {{FILE|vasprun.xml}} has the same ordering of bands and '''k''' points, i.e., the band index is always the fastest. The frequency grid cannot be controlled. It is always 1000 points in the range of -150 to 150.

=== Imaginary frequencies ===

For [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Low_scaling_GW_algorithms|low-scaling GW algorithms]], the QP shifts are evaluated and printed to {{FILE|OUTCAR}} for both, {{TAG|LSELFENERGY}}=T and F. For {{TAG|LSELFENERGY}}=T, the {{FILE|vasprun.xml}} file additionally contains the self-energy for a given band index and '''k''' point on the imaginary-frequency axis:

 <varray name="selfenergy along imaginary axis" >
   <v>       0.1570801806644298    -23.7971327349915711     -0.0179645094529067</v>
   <v>       0.4718033117773284    -23.7968260788831572     -0.0537856829291801</v>
   <v>       0.8108804505648752    -23.7966749072893577     -0.0932103588740998</v>
   <v>       1.3058951128526406    -23.7949927690568188     -0.1482973553314607</v>
 ...
To identify the band index and '''k''' point, the ordering has to be taken from the QP shifts block in the {{FILE|OUTCAR}}. The band index is faster than the '''k''' point.
The imaginary frequency is selected by the Minimax routines{{cite|Kaltak:PRB:2020}}, and the number of points depends on {{TAG|NOMEGA}}.
