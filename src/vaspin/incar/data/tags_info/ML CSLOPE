{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_CSLOPE}}
{{TAGDEF|ML_CSLOPE|[real]|<math>0.2</math>}}

Description: Parameter used in the automatic determination of threshold for error estimation in the machine learning force field method.
----
The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: [[Machine learning force field calculations: Basics#Threshold for error of forces|here]].

The standard error of the history of maximum estimated errors of the forces ({{TAG|ML_MHIS}}) and it's slope must be below {{TAG|ML_CSIG}} and {{TAG|ML_CSLOPE}} so that an update of the threshold for the maximum estimated error of forces {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}} can take place.
