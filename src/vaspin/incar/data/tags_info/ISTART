{{DEF|ISTART|1|if a {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file exists|0|else}}

Description: {{TAG|ISTART}} determines whether or not to read the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file.
----
*{{TAG|ISTART}}=0
:Start job: "begin from scratch". Initialize the orbitals according to the flag {{TAG|INIWAV}}.
*{{TAG|ISTART}}=1
:Continuation job: "restart with constant energy cut-off". Orbitals are read from the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file (usage is restricted in the parallel version). The set of plane waves will be redefined and re-padded according to the new cell size/shape ({{FILE|POSCAR}}) and the new plane wave cut-off ({{FILE|INCAR}}). These values might differ from the old values, that are stored in the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file. If the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file is missing or if the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file contains an inappropriate number of bands and/or k-points the flag {{TAG|ISTART}} will revert to {{TAG|ISTART}}=0 (see above).

:The usage of {{TAG|ISTART}}=1 is recommended if the size/shape of the supercell (see section on [[Volume relaxation|volume relaxations]]) or the cut-off energy changed with respect to the last run and if one wishes to redefine the set of plane waves according to a new setting.

:{{TAG|ISTART}}=1 is the usual setting for convergence tests with respect to the cut-off energy and for all jobs where the volume/cell-shape varies (e.g. to calculate binding energy curves looping over a set of volumes).

*{{TAG|ISTART}}=2
:Continuation job: "restart with constant basis set". Orbitals are read from the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file.

:The set of plane waves will '''not''' be changed even if the cut-off energy or the cell size/shape given on the {{FILE|INCAR}} and {{FILE|POSCAR}} files are different from the values stored on the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file. If the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file is missing or if the {{FILE|WAVECAR}} file contains an inappropriate number of bands and/or k-points the {{TAG|ISTART}} will revert to {{TAG|ISTART}}=0 (see above).

:If the cell shape has not changed then {{TAG|ISTART}}=1 and {{TAG|ISTART}}=2 lead to the same result.

:{{TAG|ISTART}}=2 is usually used if one wishes to restart with the same basis set used in the previous run.
{{NB|mind| Due to [[Pulay stress|Pulay stresses]], there is a difference between evaluating the equilibrium volume with a constant basis set and a constant energy cut-off (unless absolute convergence with respect to the basis set is achieved!).|:}}
:If you are looking for the equilibrium volume, calculations with a constant energy cut-off are preferable to calculations with a constant basis set, therefore always restart with {{TAG|ISTART}}=1 unless you really know what you are looking for (see the section on [[Volume relaxation|volume relaxations]]).

:There is only one exception to this general rule: all volume/cell shape relaxation algorithms implemented in VASP work with a constant basis set, so continuing such jobs requires to set {{TAG|ISTART}}=2 to get a 'consistent restart' with respect to the previous runs (see section [[Volume relaxation|volume relaxations]])! This menas that that number of plane waves is consistent with the previous run but the energy cut-off is not (see section [[Pulay stress|Pulay stress]]).

*{{TAG|ISTART}}=3
:Continuation job: "full restart including orbitals and charge prediction".

:Same as {{TAG|ISTART}}=2 but in addition a valid {{FILE|TMPCAR}} file must exist, containing the positions and orbitals at time steps <math>t(N-1)</math> and <math>t(N-2)</math>, which are needed for the orbital and charge prediction scheme (used for MD-runs).

:{{TAG|ISTART}}=3 is generally not recommended unless an operating system imposes a serious restriction on the CPU time per job: if you continue with {{TAG|ISTART}}=1 or 2, a relatively large number of electronic iterations might be necessary to reach convergence of the orbitals in the second and third molecular-dynamics steps. {{TAG|ISTART}}=3 therefore saves time and is important if a molecular-dynamics run is split into very small pieces (e.g., {{TAG|NSW}}<10).

:Nevertheless, we have found that it is safer to restart the orbital prediction after 100 to 200 steps. If {{TAG|NSW}}>30, {{TAG|ISTART}}=1 or 2 is strongly recommended.
{{NB|mind| If {{TAG|ISTART}}{{=}}3, a non-existing {{FILE|WAVECAR}} or {{FILE|TMPCAR}} file or any inconsistency of input data will immediately stop execution.|:}}
