{{TAGDEF|ML_OUTBLOCK|[integer]|1}}

Description: Output distance in number of steps for molecular-dynamics simulations with machine-learned force fields in prediction-only mode ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|run}}).
{{NB|important|This tag is only available as of VASP.6.4.0. Unfortunately, the implementation of this feature was incomplete before VASP.6.4.3. In {{VASP}} versions prior to 6.4.3 there was still substantial remaining per-time-step output, in particular in {{FILE|vasprun.xml}} and {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} (see table below). If possible, please use VASP.6.4.3 or higher for production runs with potentially large file output.}}

By default {{VASP}} writes all results at every molecular-dynamics step ({{TAGO|ML_OUTBLOCK|1}}). However, this may become inefficient when running long trajectories in production runs with a machine-learned force field in prediction-only mode ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|run}}). This is particularly true if the force field supports the fast execution mode, i.e., refitting was performed with {{TAGO|ML_MODE|refit}}. Then, depending on the system size, writing output each time step may hinder performance, cause heavy I/O load and create unnecessary large files. In order to circumvent these problems {{TAGO|ML_OUTBLOCK|n}} instructs {{VASP}} to write screen and file output only every <code>n</code> time steps.

In order to further increase the efficiency, calculation and output of pair-correlation functions can be completely switched off by setting {{TAGO|ML_OUTPUT_MODE|0}}. {{NB|warning|This tag will potentially override defaults and {{FILE|INCAR}} values of {{TAG|NBLOCK}}! {{TAG|NBLOCK}} will be automatically set to the maximum of {{TAG|ML_OUTBLOCK}} and {{TAG|NBLOCK}}.}} A comparison of the effects of {{TAG|NBLOCK}} and {{TAG|ML_OUTBLOCK}} on the output frequency of different files/properties is given in the following table. Here, "yes" means the output will only be written in the interval in time steps given by the tag value. On the other hand, "no" indicates that the output will be written every time step regardless of the tag value. {{Table - Output interval options}}
