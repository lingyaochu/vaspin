{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_MCONF_NEW}}
{{TAGDEF|ML_MCONF_NEW|[integer]|5}}

Description: This tag sets the number of configurations that are stored temporarily as candidates for the training data in the machine learning force field method.
----
{{NB|warning|This value is close to optimal for on-the-fly learning,  and should usually not be changed. }}

The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: [[Machine learning force field calculations: Basics#Sampling of training data and local reference configurations|here]].
If force fields are reparameterized ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|select}}), calculations are usually more efficient if this parameter is increased to values around 10-16 and setting {{TAGO|ML_CDOUB|4}}. This is particularly relevant if the ML_AB file is large.
