{{TAGDEF|VACPOTFLAT|[real]|0.1}}

Description: Maximum permissible 2D-averaged electric field for a region considered to be field-free in eV/Å.
----

A region of space is considered to be field-free if the 2D-averaged electric field ({{TAG|LVACPOTAV}}=True) is smaller than {{TAG|VACPOTFLAT}}.
{{NB|tip| Increase {{TAG|VACPOTFLAT}} for a quick estimation of the vacuum potential and decrease for a precise value. If the cell is large and {{TAG|EDIFF}} small, the final result of {{TAG|LVACPOTAV}} should be independent of {{TAG|VACPOTFLAT}}.}}
