Description: Selects which diagonalization algorithm to use for the optional k-points driver
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

Sometimes, the electronic Kohn-Sham orbitals are required on an alternative k-point mesh, for example via {{FILE|KPOINTS_OPT}} or {{FILE|KPOINTS_ELPH}}.
In this case, the tag {{TAG|KPOINTS_OPT_MODE}} selects which diagonalization algorithm should be used to obtain these eigenvalues.

== Tag options ==
;{{TAGO|KPOINTS_OPT_MODE|0}}
:The diagonalization of the Hamiltonian at the alternative k-points is skipped entirely
;{{TAGO|KPOINTS_OPT_MODE|1}}
:Uses the [[Blocked-Davidson algorithm]] (same as {{TAGO|ALGO|Normal}})
;{{TAGO|KPOINTS_OPT_MODE|2}}
:Performs an exact diagonalization (same as {{TAGO|ALGO|Exact}})
