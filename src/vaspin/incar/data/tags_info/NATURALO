{{TAGDEF|NATURALO|[integer]|0; for low scaling GW type calculations the default is 4}}

Description: calculate RPA natural orbitals.
----

This flag should be used in combination with {{TAG|ALGO}} = G0W0R or {{TAG|ALGO}} = scGW0R.  The VASP code diagonalizes the RPA density
matrix and writes the final natural orbitals to the {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file.
The one-electron occupancies on the {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file can also be updated to the eigenvalues of the RPA density matrix. For {{TAG|ALGO}} = G0W0R, the interacting Green's function is approximated as

<math>
G = G_0 + G_0 \Sigma G_0
</math>

whereas for  {{TAG|ALGO}} = scGW0R the Dyson equation is solved

<math>
G = G_0 + G \Sigma G_0.
</math>

In both cases, the RPA density matrix is determined as <math> \gamma= \lim_{\tau \to 0^-} G(\tau) </math>. More details on the use of RPA natural orbitals can be found in Ref. <ref name="ramberger2019rpa"/>.

The following settings are currently supported

* {{TAG|NATURALO}}=0 calculate the density matrix, diagonalize the matrix and write the natural orbitals and eigenvalues of the density matrix to {{TAG|WAVECAR}}. The eigenvalues of the density matrix are stored in the occupancy entries of the {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file, whereas the one-electron DFT eigenvalues remain untouched. This setting is usually not particularly useful for practical calculations and should be used only by experts. Furthermore, {{TAG|LFINITE_TEMPERATURE}} should not be combined with this setting.

* {{TAG|NATURALO}}=1 calculate the density matrix, diagonalize the matrix only in the sub-block of unoccupied states, and write the occupied Kohn Sham orbitals, as well as the natural orbitals corresponding to unoccupied states to the file {{TAG|WAVECAR}}. The unoccupied orbitals are ordered according to their occupancies in the RPA density matrix. The one-electron occupancies and KS-DFT eigenvalues are not updated from their KS values (the occupancies will remain 1 for occupied Kohn-Sham orbitals and 0 for natural orbitals representing the virtual manifold). This setting has been used in Ref. <ref name="ramberger2019rpa"/>. See also Ref. <ref name="GruneisNO"/> for further information. Note that all orbitals- even those with a tiny fractional occupancy -are treated as occupied orbitals and not updated: the algorithm should hence even work for metallic systems.

* {{TAG|NATURALO}}<0. Similar to  {{TAG|NATURALO}}=1 but additionally conserves ABS|{{TAG|NATURALO}}| unoccupied Kohn-Sham states. This is expedient, for subsequent GW and BSE calculations to conserve  few unoccupied orbitals to their Kohn-Sham states.

* If 10 is added (e.g. {{TAG|NATURALO}}=10, {{TAG|NATURALO}}=11) the density matrix is diagonalizes using a perturbative Loewdin algorithm that attempts to keep the orbital order strictly conserved: E.g. the natural orbital matching closest to each Kohn-Sham orbital will be determined and stored. Use this tag for metals.

* {{TAG|NATURALO}}=2 (or 12) is similar to 0, but the one-electron occupancies are not updated. In rare cases this might lead to inconsistencies, if the orbital order changes between DFT and the RPA density matrix (i.e. a previously occupied DFT orbitals posses a smaller occupation in the RPA density matrix than some unoccupied Kohn-Sham orbitals and are moved into the unoccupied block). This problem can be reduced using {{TAG|NATURALO}}=12, as described above. This flag, in combination with {{TAG|ALGO}} = scGW0R, can be used to evaluate the GW-singles contribution to the correlation energy.<ref name="Klimessingles"/> One can deduct the HF singles and the GW singles energies from the energies after

     Energies after diagonalization of HF Hamiltonian (single shot)
     Hartree-Fock free energy of the ion-electron system (eV)

     Energies after update of density matrix
     Hartree-Fock free energy of the ion-electron system (eV)

Experience has shown that there is very little difference between the natural orbitals obtained using {{TAG|ALGO}} = G0W0R and {{TAG|ALGO}} = scGW0R. We strongly recommend to use the more efficient and better tested algorithm {{TAG|ALGO}} = G0W0R (with the exception of GW-singles) to determine natural orbitals. Furthermore, perform careful tests for {{TAG|NOMEGA}}: the RPA total energy converges much faster then the natural orbitals. Using a too small {{TAG|NOMEGA}} can yield natural orbitals that are non-optimal, leading to very slow convergence of correlated calculations with respect to the number of natural orbitals.
A crucial test is that the following line

 correlated contrib. to density matrix         0.0000004037        0.0000000000

in the stdout and OUTCAR file shows values close to zero (for {{TAG|ALGO}} = G0W0R). The above value is perfectly acceptable and the value decreases as {{TAG|NOMEGA}} increases.

* {{TAG|NATURALO}}=4 preserves original (DFT) orbitals but updates the eigenvalues in the {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file to the QP energies. This mode is useful if only quasi-particle energies are corrected with the GW method, for instance when selecting {{TAG|ALGO}}=[[GW calculations#gw0|EVGW0R]].
