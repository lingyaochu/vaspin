{{TAGDEF|ISPIN|1 {{!}} 2|1}}

Description: {{TAG|ISPIN}} specifies spin polarization.
----
*{{TAG|ISPIN}}=1: non-spin-polarized calculations are performed.
*{{TAG|ISPIN}}=2: spin-polarized calculations (collinear) are performed.

By combining {{TAG|ISPIN}} with {{TAG|MAGMOM}} collinear magnetism can be studied.
{{NB|important| For noncollinear calculations {{TAG|ISPIN}} is ignored. In VASP 6.5.0, the calculation will exit with an error message if {{TAG|ISPIN}}{{=}}2 and {{TAG|MAGMOM}} is used in combination with the {{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}}{{=}}.TRUE.|}}
