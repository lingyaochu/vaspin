Description: Tag to control the minimum interval to get training samples in the machine learning force field method.
----
The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: [[Machine_learning_force_field:_Theory#Sampling_of_training_data_and_local_reference_configurations|here]]

This tag defines a lower threshold for taking new configurations from the MD, so that as long as the upper threshold for the Bayesian error (e.g. {{TAG|ML_CDOUB}} times {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}}) is not exceeded,  at least {{TAG|ML_NMDINT}} MD steps are preformed using the MLFF (i.e. no first principles calculation is performed). This avoids that many nearly identical structures are added.
