{{TAGDEF|NBLK|[integer]}}
{{DEF|NBLK|-1|VASP.4.6|256|in VASP.5.2, if dfast}}

Description: {{TAG|NBLK}} determines the blocking factor in many BLAS level 3 routines.

In some cases, VASP has to perform a unitary transformation of the current orbitals. This is done using a work array CBLOCK and the following FORTRAN code:
       DO 100 IBLOCK=0,NPL-1,NBLK
          ILEN=MIN(NBLK,NPL-IBLOCK)
          DO 200 N1=1,N
             DO 200 M=1,ILEN
             CBLOCK(M,N1)=C(M+IBLOCK,N1)
             C(M+IBLOCK,N1)=0
   200    CONTINUE
 C        C(IBLOCK+I,N)=SUM_(J,K) CH(I,K) CBLOCK(K,N)
          CALL ZGEMM ('N', 'N', ILEN, N, N, (1.,0.), CBLOCK, NBLK, CH, N,
               &   (1.,0.), C(IBLOCK+1,1), NDIM)
   100 CONTINUE

ZGEMM is the matrix <math>\times</math> matrix  multiplication command of the BLAS package. The task performed by this call is indicated by the comment line written above the ZGEMM call. Generally {{TAG|NBLK}}=16 or 32 is large enough for super-scalar machines. A large value might be necessary on vector machines for optimal performance ({{TAG|NBLK}}=128).
