{{TAGDEF|LBLUEOUT|.TRUE.{{!}}.FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: for {{TAG|LBLUEOUT}}=.TRUE., VASP writes output for the free-energy gradient calculation to the {{FILE|REPORT}} file (in case VASP was compiled with [[Precompiler_flags|-Dtbdyn]]).
----
If LBLUEOUT=.TRUE., the information needed to compute the free-energy gradient is written in the {{FILE|REPORT}} file after each molecular-dynamics step ({{TAG|MDALGO}}=1 {{!}} 2), check the lines after the header:

 >Blue_moon
        lambda         |z|^(-1/2)      GkT           |z|^(-1/2)*(lambda+GkT)

For the theory of the blue-moon ensemble we refer to [[Blue-moon ensemble|here]].
