{{TAGDEF|NELMIN|[integer]|2}}

Description: {{TAG|NELMIN}} specifies the minimum number of electronic self-consistency steps.
----
It is rarely necessary to change the value of the {{TAG|NELMIN}} tag. In some cases, e.g., in [[:Category:Molecular dynamics|molecular-dynamics]] runs, or [[:Category:Ionic minimization|ionic-minimization]] methods, we recommend increasing the {{TAG|NELMIN}} tag to a value between 4 and 8.
