{{TAGDEF|LSYNCH5|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LSYNCH5}} determines whether the output in {{FILE|vaspout.h5}} is always synchronized with VASP while the calculation is running.

-----

If you set this flag, VASP will enable single-writer-multiple-reader mode for the HDF5 file.
This allows you to monitor the output using {{py4vasp}} while the calculation is still running.
{{NB|mind|Synchronizing the HDF5 file continuously comes with a computational cost. Please do your own testing whether that is a bottleneck for your calculation.}}
