{{TAGDEF|ELPH_POT_FFT_MESH|[real real real]}}

Description: Specifies the FFT mesh for mapping the electron-phonon potential to the primitive cell.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

Once the electron-phonon potential [[Electron-phonon_potential_from_supercells|has been computed in the supercell]], it needs to be mapped to the primitive cell.
By default, VASP chooses the primitive-cell FFT mesh to be consistent with the current {{TAG|ENCUT}}.
However, sometimes it might be necessary to specify the FFT grid dimensions manually via {{TAG|ELPH_POT_FFT_MESH}}.

The chosen values must be the same as the desired {{TAG|NGX}}, {{TAG|NGY}} and {{TAG|NGZ}} of the electron-phonon calculation in the primitive cell.
{{NB|tip|In order to find the FFT grid dimensions corresponding to the primitive cell, you can start a minimal VASP calculation in the primitive cell and extract the values for {{TAG|NGX}}, {{TAG|NGY}} and {{TAG|NGZ}} from the {{FILE|OUTCAR}} file.}}
