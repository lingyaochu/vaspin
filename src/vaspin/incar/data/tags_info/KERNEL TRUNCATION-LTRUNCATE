{{TAGDEF|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE| .True. {{!}} .False.|.False.}}

Description: {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE}} truncates the coulomb kernel to remove electrostatic interactions along non-periodic dimensions
----
Setting {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE}} = T  switches on coulomb kernel truncation methods. These methods removes interactions with periodic replicas in non-periodic directions, i.e. along the surface normal for 2D materials and along all directions for 0D systems such as atoms and molecules.
{{NB|mind|This tag acts as a "super-tag", i.e. unless this tag is switched on further options in KERNEL_TRUNCATION will be ignored.}}

== Default settings ==

The following default settings are assumed when setting {{TAG|KERNEL_TRUNCATION/LTRUNCATE}} = T,

   KERNEL_TRUNCATION {
         LTRUNCATE      = T
         IDIMENSIONALITY = 0
         LCOARSEN       = T
   }

which translates to 0D coulomb truncation which is suitable for a molecule using the coarsen before pad strategy{{cite|vijay:arxiv:2024}}. Detailed information is available on the respective pages of the {{FILE|INCAR}} tags.
