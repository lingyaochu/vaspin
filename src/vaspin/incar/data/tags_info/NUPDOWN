{{TAGDEF|NUPDOWN|[positive real]|not set}}

Description: Sets the difference between the number of electrons in the up and down spin components.

----


Allows calculations for a specific spin multiplet, i.e. the difference of the number of electrons in the up and down spin component will be kept fixed to the specified value. There is a word of caution required: If {{TAG|NUPDOWN}} is set in the {{TAG|INCAR}} file the initial moment for the charge density should be the same. Otherwise convergence can slow down. When starting from atomic charge densities ({{TAG|ICHARG}}=2), VASP will try to do this automatically by setting {{TAG|MAGMOM}} to {{TAG|NUPDOWN}}/{{TAG|NIONS}}. The user can of course overwrite this default by specifying a different {{TAG|MAGMOM}} (which should still result in the correct total moment). If one initializes the charge density from the one-electron wavefunctions, the initial moment is always correct, because VASP "pushes" the required number of electrons from the down to the up component. Initializing the charge density from the {{TAG|CHGCAR}} file ({{TAG|ICHARG}}=1), however, the initial moment is usually incorrect!

If no value is set (or {{TAG|NUPDOWN}}=-1) a full relaxation will be performed. This is also the default.
