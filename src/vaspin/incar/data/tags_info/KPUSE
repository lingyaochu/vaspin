{{TAGDEF|KPUSE|[integer array]|not set}}

Description: {{TAG|KPUSE}} sets a list of '''k''' points that contribute to calculating the [[Band-decomposed charge densities|partial charge density]].
----
{{TAG|IBAND}} selects a subset of ''k''' points for which the partial charge density is calculated when {{TAG|LPARD}} = .TRUE..
Partial charge densities are written to the {{FILE|PARCHG}} file, or one of its variants, depending on the setting of {{TAG|LSEPB}} and {{TAG|LSEPK}}.
{{NB|mind|All '''k''' point weights will be internally reset to 1 if {{TAG|KPUSE}} is specified. Thus results are usually only correct if the groundstate calculation and the partial charge post-processing is performed with {{TAG|ISYM}} {{=}} -1.}}
E.g. if <code>KPUSE = 1 4 7</code>
the charge density will be calculated for the three '''k''' points 1, 4, and 7.
