{{DEF|INIWAV|1|}}

Description: Specifies how to set up the initial orbitals in case {{TAG|ISTART}}=0.
----
*{{TAG|INIWAV}}=0
:Take 'jellium orbitals', i.e., fill the Kohn-Sham&ndash;orbital arrays with plane waves of lowest kinetic energy = lowest eigenvectors for a constant potential ('jellium').
{{NB|important| 'jellium' calculations require a specific {{FILE|POTCAR}} file, not included in the standard potential database.|:}}

*{{TAG|INIWAV}}=1
:Fill the Kohn-Sham&ndash;orbital arrays with random numbers. It is definitely the safest fool-proof switch.
{{NB|tip|Use {{TAG|INIWAV}}{{=}}1 whenever possible.|:}}
{{NB|mind|The {{TAG|INIWAV}} tag is only used for jobs that start from scratch ({{TAG|ISTART}}{{=}}0) and has no meaning otherwise.}}
