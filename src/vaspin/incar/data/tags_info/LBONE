{{TAGDEF|LBONE|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .FALSE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LBONE}} adds the small ''B''-component to the chemical shift tensor.
----
{{TAG|LBONE}} restores the small ''B''-component of the wave function inside
the PAW spheres in the linear-response calculation of the NMR chemical shift
tensor. The POTCARs used in VASP are scalar-relativistic and the
AE-partial waves are solutions of the scalar-relativistic Kohn-Sham
equation for the spherical atom. These have a large (''A'') and a small (''B'') component.
The latter is not retained on the POTCAR, but approximately restored when {{TAG|LBONE}}=.TRUE. {{Cite|dewijs:laskowski:jcp:2017}}.
{{TAG|LBONE}} only affects the one-center valence contributions to the chemical shift. The contribution of the core electrons includes the ''B''-component by default.
