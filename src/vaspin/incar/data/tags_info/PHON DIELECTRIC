Description: {{TAG|PHON_DIELECTRIC}} sets the static dielectric tensor to be used for the dipole-dipole corrections in the computation of the phonon dispersion. This is only used when {{TAG|LPHON_POLAR}}=.TRUE.
----

If the material is non-metallic and polar (i.e. two or more atoms in the unit cell carry nonzero Born effective charge tensors), a special treatment of the long-range dipole-dipole interaction is required to obtain a smooth phonon dispersion.
This is activated by setting {{TAG|LPHON_POLAR}}=.TRUE. and supplying the static dielectric tensor ({{TAG|PHON_DIELECTRIC}}) and the Born-effective charges ({{TAG|PHON_BORN_CHARGES}}) which can be obtained in a separate VASP calculation using the {{TAG|LEPSILON}} or {{TAG|LCALCEPS}} tag.
The dipole-dipole part of the interatomic force-constants is evaluated using an Ewald summation with the number of <math>\mathbf{G}</math> vectors determined by the cutoff length ({{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}}).
