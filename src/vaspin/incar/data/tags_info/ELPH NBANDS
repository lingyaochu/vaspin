Description: Number of bands to compute on the dense <b>k</b> point grid for the electron-phonon driver
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
For [[Transport coefficients including electron-phonon scattering|transport calculations]], this value should be as little as possible while including all the states potentially participating in the transport calculation.

If {{TAG|ELPH_NBANDS}}=-2 then the number of bands is set to the maximum number of plane waves. This setting is particularly useful for calculating the [[Bandgap renormalization due to electron-phonon coupling| bandgap renormalization]].
In this case, the final result converges slowly with the number of bands in the calculation, similar to [[RPA/ACFDT: Correlation energy in the Random Phase Approximation|RPA]], and [[BSE calculations|BSE]] calculations.
