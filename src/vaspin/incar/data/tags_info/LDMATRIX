Description: Computes the zero-field splitting (ZFS) matrix.
----

To compute the zero-field-splitting (ZFS) tensor due to spin-spin interactions in a collinear magnetic calculation ({{TAGO|ISPIN|2}}), set:

  {{TAGBL|LDMATRIX}} = True
  # sets default {{TAGBL|LHFCALC}} = True ; {{TAGBL|AEXX}}=0.0

The ZFS arises from spin-spin interactions between unpaired electrons in a high-spin state with a total spin <math> S \geq 1 </math>. The ZFS matrix, also called D matrix, is measured in electron-spin resonance (ESR) experiments and provides insights into the local electronic environment of defect centers.

The implementation follows the formalism of Rayson and Briddon (2008){{Cite|rayson:prb:2008}}, which efficiently evaluates the spin-spin interaction within periodic density-functional theory (DFT) using reciprocal space methods. This approach avoids expensive six-dimensional real-space integrations, leading to a stable and computationally efficient method. The expressions are similar to integrals used to evaluate the exact exchange energies for [[:Category:Hybrid functionals|hybrid and HF-type calculation]], hence VASP sets {{TAGO|LHFCALC|True}}. This still allows for simple DFT calculations ({{TAGO|AEXX|0.0}} default), however mind that the default symmetrization is {{TAGO|ISYM|3}}. {{TAG|LDMATRIX}} should not be combined with {{TAGO|ISYM|1}}, or <code>2</code>.

== Advice ==
* [[Choosing pseudopotentials|Choice of PAW potentials]]: The ZFS tensor values can be sensitive to the specific [[:Category:Pseudopotentials|PAW potential]] used, as different [[:Category:Pseudopotentials|pseudopotentials]] include varying number of electrons in the valence. In particular, it is crucial that the states that give rise to the magnetic moment are included.
* {{TAG|NUPDOWN}} tag can be used to obtain a high-spin state.
* The {{TAG|LDMATRIX}} implementation is best tested for <code>vasp_std</code>. A bug for <code>vasp_gam</code> with {{TAGO|NCORE|1|op=>}} has been fixed, see [[Known_issues#KnownIssue33a|D-matrix broken for vasp_gam]].
{{NB|warning| {{TAG|LDMATRIX}} cannot be used with noncollinear magnetic calculations ({{TAG|LNONCOLLINEAR}} and/or {{TAG|LSORBIT}}).|:}}
* Spin-contamination corrections: Some users have modified the source code to include spin-contamination corrections, particularly for low-spin states (<math>S=0</math>). These modifications are ''not'' included in the default VASP version but can be implemented manually. See forum discussion: https://vasp.at/forum/viewtopic.php?p=29801p29801
