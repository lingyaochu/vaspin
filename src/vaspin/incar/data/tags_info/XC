Description: Specifies a combination of exchange-correlation functionals.
----
A combination of semilocal (LDA, GGA, and METAGGA) functionals can be set with the {{TAG|XC}} tag, which provides much more flexibility in the choice of the functional compared to the {{TAG|GGA}} and {{TAG|METAGGA}} tags. The functionals that can be combined are the functionals implemented in VASP (listed at {{TAG|GGA}} and {{TAG|METAGGA}}) and the functionals implemented in Libxc{{cite|marques:cpc:2012}}{{cite|lehtola:sx:2018}}{{cite|libxc}} (listed on the Libxc website{{cite|libxc_list}}). The combination can consist of up to 100 components; for each, a multiplication factor can be set with the {{TAG|XC_C}} tag.
{{NB|mind|This tag is available since VASP.6.4.3.}}
