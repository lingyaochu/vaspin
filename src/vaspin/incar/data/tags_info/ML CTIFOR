Description: This flag sets the threshold for the error estimation in the machine learning force field method.
----
The use of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: [[Machine learning force field calculations: Basics#Sampling of training data and local reference configurations|here]]. Generally, first principles calculations are only performed if the error estimate of one force exceeds the threshold.

The initial threshold is set to the value provided by the tag {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}} (units of eV/Angstrom for {{TAG|ML_CALGO}}=0 and unitless for {{TAG|ML_CALGO}}=1).

For {{TAG|ML_CALGO}}=0, the threshold can be updated dynamically during ML. The details of the update are controlled by {{TAG|ML_ICRITERIA}}. Typically, after extensive training, attainable values for ML_CTIFOR are 0.02 around 300-500 K, and 0.06 around 1000-2000 K, so temperature but also system dependent. The initial default 0.002 is only sensible, if {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}}  is automatically updated ({{TAG|ML_ICRITERIA}} = 1 or 2). If  {{TAG|ML_ICRITERIA}} = 0 is used, it is necessary to use significantly larger values around 0.02-0.06 for {{TAG|ML_CTIFOR}}.

For {{TAG|ML_CALGO}}=1, only a constant threshold during the calculation is available ({{TAG|ML_ICRITERIA}}=0).

The related tag {{TAG|ML_SCLC_CTIFOR}} determines how many local reference configurations are chosen from each first principles calculations.
