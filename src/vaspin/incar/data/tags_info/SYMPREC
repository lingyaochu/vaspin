{{TAGDEF|SYMPREC|[real]|<math>10^{-5}</math>}}

Description: {{TAG|SYMPREC}} determines to which accuracy the positions in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file must be specified (as of VASP.4.4.4).
----
{{TAG|SYMPREC}} determines how accurately the positions in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file must be specified.
The default, {{TAG|SYMPREC}}=10<sup>-5</sup>, is usually large enough, even if the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file has been generated with single precision accuracy.
Increasing {{TAG|SYMPREC}} means that the positions in the {{FILE|POSCAR}} file can be specified with less accuracy (increasing fuzziness). Please also have a look at [[POSCAR#Precision_and_symmetry|this section]].
