{{TAGDEF|LHARTREE|[logical]|.TRUE.}}

Description: Controls whether the bubble diagrams are included in the {{TAG|BSE}} calculation.

----

{{TAG|LADDER}} is used together with {{TAG|LHARTREE}}. If {{TAG|LADDER}}=''.FALSE.'', the ladder diagrams, i.e., the exchange terms related to <math>W</math> or the screened exchange, are not included.
If {{TAG|LHARTREE}}=''.FALSE.'', the Hartree diagrams or bubble diagrams are not included. The following table summarizes all possible combinations:

::{| cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" border="1"
|{{TAG|LHARTREE}} || {{TAG|LADDER}} ||
|-
| .TRUE. || .TRUE. || full BSE / TDHF
|-
| .FALSE. || .TRUE. || only excitonic effects (ladders)
|-
| .TRUE. || .FALSE. || random phase approximation (rings = bubbles only)
|-
| .FALSE. || .FALSE. || independent particle picture
|}

The last combination can be useful for sanity checks: the results must be identical to the results obtained using
{{TAG|LOPTICS}}=''.TRUE.'' in the preceding calculations. If this is not the case, it usually implies that the one-electron
energies have been updated in the {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file, or that the  {{TAG|WAVEDER}} file is not properly set up. The end of [[BSE calculations|BSE]] explains how to recalculate the {{TAG|WAVEDER}} file from an existing {{TAG|WAVECAR}} file.
