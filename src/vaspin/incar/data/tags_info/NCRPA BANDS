{{DISPLAYTITLE:NCRPA_BANDS}}
{{TAGDEF|NCRPA_BANDS|[integer array]}}

Description: Controls which bands are excluded in the constrained random phase approximation. Check also {{TAG|NTARGET_STATES}}.

----
This tag is effective for {{TAG|ALGO}}=CRPA and ignored otherwise.

For instance
 NCRPA_BANDS = 21 22 23
removes all screening effects between bands 21, 22 and 23 in the random phase approximation of the screened Coulomb interaction.
