{{TAGDEF|EFIELD|[real]}}

Description: {{TAG|EFIELD}} controls the magnitude of the applied electric force field.
----
It is possible to apply an external electrostatic field in slab, or molecular calculations. Presently only a single value can be supplied and the field is applied in the direction selected by {{TAG|IDIPOL}}=1-4. The electric force field is supplied in units of eV/&Aring;. Dipole corrections to the potential ({{TAG|LDIPOL}}=.TRUE.) can and should be turned on to avoid interactions between the periodically repeated images.
{{NB|mind|The electric field is defined opposite to the common definition. So electrons will move along the direction of the electric field.}}
