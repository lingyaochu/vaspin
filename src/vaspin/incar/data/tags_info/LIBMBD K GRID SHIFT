Description: {{TAG|LIBMBD_K_GRID_SHIFT}} sets the shift for the k-mesh of the collective oscillations defined in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods{{cite|libmbd_1}}{{cite|libmbd_2}}{{cite|hermann:jcp:2023}}.

{{TAG|LIBMBD_K_GRID_SHIFT}} allows to choose a shift for the k-mesh of the collective oscillations defined in the methods available in the library libMBD of many-body dispersion methods. The value is internally passed to the libMBD input '''k_grid_shift''' described at the page {{cite|libmbd_input}}.
{{NB|important| This feature is available from VASP.6.4.3 onwards that needs to be compiled with [[Precompiler_options#-DLIBMBD|-DLIBMBD]].}}
libMBD is a separate library package that has to be downloaded{{cite|libmbd_2}} and compiled before VASP is compiled with the corresponding [[Precompiler_options#-DLIBMBD|precompiler options]] and [[Makefile.include#LIBMBD_.28optional.29|links to the libraries]].
