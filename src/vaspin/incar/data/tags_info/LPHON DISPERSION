{{DEF|LPHON_DISPERSION|.FALSE.|}}

Description: {{TAG|LPHON_DISPERSION}} requests the calculation of the phonon dispersion along the q-point path supplied in file {{TAG|QPOINTS}} (same format as {{FILE|KPOINTS}}).

----

After the computation of the force constants using finite differences ({{TAG|IBRION}}=5,6) or density-functional perturbation theory ({{TAG|IBRION}}=7,8) on a supercell it is possible to compute the phonon dispersion for the equivalent primitive cell determined by VASP by setting {{TAG|LPHON_DISPERSION}}=.TRUE.
{{NB|mind| Only available as of VASP 6.3.2.}}
