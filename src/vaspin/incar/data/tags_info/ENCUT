Description: {{TAG|ENCUT}} specifies the energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set in eV.

----
All plane waves with a kinetic energy smaller than <math>E_{\mathrm{cut}}</math> are included in the basis set, i.e.,

::<math> | \mathbf{G} + \mathbf{k} | < G_{\mathrm{cut}} </math> with <math> E_{\mathrm{cut}} = \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} G^2_{\mathrm{cut}} </math>

With this energy cutoff, the number of plane waves included in the basis set depends on the '''k'''-point, leading to a superior behavior. For instance, for energy-volume calculations the total number of plane waves changes fairly smoothly according to the volume, while the criterion <math>| \mathbf{G} | < G_{\mathrm{cut}} </math> (i.e. same number of plane waves for all '''k'''-points) would lead to a very rough energy-volume curve and, generally, to a slower energy convergence with respect to the basis set size.

The {{FILE|POTCAR}} files contain a default {{TAG|ENMAX}} (and {{TAG|ENMIN}}). Therefore, it is, in principle, not necessary to specify {{TAG|ENCUT}} in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file.
For calculations with more than one species, the maximum cutoff {{TAG|ENMAX}} (or {{TAG|ENMIN}}) value is used for the calculation (see {{TAG|PREC}}).
{{NB|important|
*The convergence of the quantity of interest with respect to the energy cutoff {{TAG|ENCUT}} should always be checked.
*We strongly recommend specifying the energy cutoff {{TAG|ENCUT}} always manually in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file to ensure the same accuracy between calculations. Otherwise, the default {{TAG|ENCUT}} may differ among the different calculations (e.g., for the calculation of the cohesive energy), with the consequence that the total energies, for instance, can not be compared.}}
