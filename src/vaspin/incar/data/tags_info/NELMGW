{{TAGDEF|NELMGW|[integer]|1}}

Description: {{TAG|NELMGW}} sets the number of self-consistent GW steps.
Available as of 6.3.0.

----
This tag is effective for {{TAG|ALGO}}=EVGW[0] | QPGW[0] | GW[0][R][K] and ignored otherwise.
For instance
 {{TAG|ALGO}} = EVGW0
 {{TAG|NELMGW}} = 4
performs a [[GW calculations#gw0| partially self-consistent GW calculations]], where <math>G</math> is updated four times.

Omit {{TAG|NBANDS}} and {{TAG|NELM}} to select the [[GW calculations#GW_in_one_go|single-step GW procedure]].
