{{TAGDEF|IMAGES|[integer]|0}}

Description: Defines the number of VASP calculations in separate directories, (e.g., 01, 02, 03, etc.) for [[Nudged elastic bands|nudged elastic band]] calculations, [[LTEMPER|parallel tempering]], and [[VCAIMAGES|thermodynamic integration]].
----

{{TAG|IMAGES}} sets the number of independent VASP calculations in separate directories. The primary {{FILE|INCAR}} file should be located in the root directory.
Other files such as {{FILE|KPOINTS}}, {{FILE|POTCAR}}, and {{FILE|POSCAR}} can be placed in subdirectories, e.g., 01, 02, 03, etc., or in the root directory. Files in subdirectories take precedence over those in the root directory.

See [[#Use cases|use cases]] described below.
== File handling ==
When VASP starts, it reads the file {{FILE|INCAR}} in the root directory.
Subsequently, VASP splits the MPI communicator into subgroups for each image.
If an {{FILE|INCAR}} file is present in the subdirectories 01, 02, 03, ..., VASP will process those afterward.
Otherwise, VASP continues reading from the root {{FILE|INCAR}} file.
You can also provide image-specific data in the root {{FILE|INCAR}}  file if the files are very similar

  # general INCAR tags
  IMAGES = 4
  TEBEG = 600

  # INCAR tags only on IMAGE 1
  IMAGE_1 {
    TEBEG = 400
  }

  # INCAR tags only on IMAGE 2
  IMAGE_2 {
    TEBEG = 500
  }

Here, images 3 and 4 would use {{TAG|TEBEG}}=600 because the value is not specified for the image.
The files {{TAG|KPOINTS}} and {{TAG|POTCAR}} will be read from the subdirectory if available and from the root directory otherwise.
The {{TAG|POSCAR}} file and all other input files are always read from the subdirectories.
All [[:Category:Output files|output files]] (including {{TAG|OUTCAR}} and {{TAG|OSZICAR}}) are always written to the subdirectories.

To summarize, to run a calculation with {{TAG|IMAGES}}, you provide:

* an {{FILE|INCAR}} file in the root directory
* optionally an overwriting {{FILE|INCAR}} file in the subdirectories
* {{FILE|POSCAR}} files in the subdirectories
* {{FILE|KPOINTS}} and {{FILE|POTCAR}} either in the root or in the subdirectories

== Use cases ==

; Nudged elastic bands
: If {{TAG|IMAGES}} is set without any other tag, an elastic-band calculation is performed. This defaults to the recommended nudged-elastic-band method, but other options are available by modifying the {{TAG|SPRING}} tag. Please consider the [[Nudged elastic bands|nudged-elastic-bands how-to]] and the {{TAG|SPRING}} tag for more information.

; Thermodynamic coupling-constant integrations
: When {{TAG|VCAIMAGES}} is set in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file, VASP computes a thermodynamic coupling-constant integration. This, in turn, sets {{TAG|IMAGES}}=2, running two VASP calculations in the subdirectories 01 and 02. Since this is a special case where the two calculations may have different computational costs, {{TAG|NCORE_IN_IMAGE1}} can be set to force an unequal split of the processes across the two images. The tag {{TAG|VCAIMAGES}} describes in more detail how to set up these calculations.

; Parallel tempering/replica-exchange method and performing independent calculations
: If the tag {{TAG|LTEMPER}}=.TRUE. is set in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file, VASP will perform parallel tempering calculations. In this case, it is necessary to provide different {{FILE|POSCAR}} files in each subdirectory and modify the {{TAG|TEBEG}} either by separate {{FILE|INCAR}} files or nested IMAGE_''X''/{{TAG|TEBEG}} definitions in the root {{FILE|INCAR}} file. For further details, refer to the description of the {{TAG|LTEMPER}} tag. The combination {{TAG|LTEMPER}}=.TRUE. and {{TAG|NTEMPER}}=0, also allows to run entirely independent calculations in the individual subdirectories. This might be helpful to make better use of nodes with many cores.
