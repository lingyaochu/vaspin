Description: Upper bound of the energy window in which states are considered for transport calculations.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
In transport calculations, only a small amount of electronic states around the chemical potential have a sizeable contribution.
Therefore, in order to improve performance, only states inside an energy window centered around the chemical potential are considered during the calculation.
By default, the location and width of the energy window are determined automatically by VASP.
By setting {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMIN}} and {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMAX}}, one can control the energy window manually.
