{{TAGDEF|ML_EATOM_REF|[real array]|0.0}}

Description: Reference total energies of isolated atoms used in the machine learning force field method.
----
This tag is only used if {{TAGO|ML_ISCALE_TOTEN|1}}.

If {{TAG|ML_EATOM_REF}} is not provided in the {{TAG|INCAR}} file then 0.0 is assumed for all species in the system.

By default this tag is not used since all energies are scaled to the average of the training data ({{TAGO|ML_ISCALE_TOTEN|2}}).

If this tag is used, each reference energy should be obtained from a VASP calculation of an isolated atoms in a sufficiently large simulation box. The reference is then simply taken from the Helmholtz free energy from the {{TAG|OSZICAR}} file (value following "1 F=" in that file).

The reference energies are simply set in one line as a list for each species, i.e. like the following

 ML_EATOM_REF = E_1 E_2 E_3 ...

where E_1, E_2, E_2 etc. are the energies for species 1, 2, 3 etc. (corresponding to the order they occur in the {{TAG|POTCAR}} file).

The unit of the energies is eV/atom. {{NB|mind|Reference energies are stored in the {{FILE|ML_AB}} file and are reused whenever the file is read in, i.e, in case of a continued training ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|train}} with {{FILE|ML_AB}} present), refitting ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|refit}}) or a re-selection run ({{TAGO|ML_MODE|select}}). However, since VASP 6.4.3 the values in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file take precedence, hence, reference energies from the {{FILE|ML_AB}} file can be updated by providing new values for the {{TAGO|ML_EATOM_REF}} tag in the {{FILE|INCAR}} file. In case you are unsure, check the {{FILE|ML_LOGFILE}} which lists the values actually used.}}
