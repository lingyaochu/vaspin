Description: {{TAG|NOMEGA}} specifies the number of (imaginary) frequency and imaginary time grid points.
----
Typically {{TAG|NOMEGA}} should be chosen around 50-100 (for the parallel version, {{TAG|NOMEGA}} should be dividable by the number of compute nodes to obtain maximum efficiency). For quick and memory conserving calculations, it is sufficient to set {{TAG|NOMEGA}} to values around {{TAG|NOMEGA}} = 20-30, but then you must expect errors of the order of 20-50 meV for the gap and 100-200 meV for the bottom of the conduction band. We furthermore recommend to increase {{TAG|NOMEGA}} not beyond 100 for a <math>k</math>-point sampling of 4&times;4&times;4 points/atom: the joint DOS and the self-energy tend to possess spurious fine structure related to the finite <math>k</math>-point grid. This fine structure is smoothed when smaller values for {{TAG|NOMEGA}} are used or if more <math>k</math>-points are used. For 6&times;6&times;6 <math>k</math>-points/atom {{TAG|NOMEGA}} can be usually increased to 200-300 without noticing problems associated with this kind of noise.

Note that the spectral method (see {{TAG|LSPECTRAL}}) scales very favorable with respect to the number of frequency points hence {{TAG|NOMEGA}}=30 is usually only slightly faster than {{TAG|NOMEGA}}=100.

*N.B: Low-scaling GW and RPA/ACFDT calculations require considerably fewer imaginary frequency (and time) points.
