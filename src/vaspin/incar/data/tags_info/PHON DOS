Description: Select the approach to use when computing the phonon density-of-states (DOS).

----

The possible values are

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! PHON_DOS !! Function
|-
| 0 || The phonon DOS computation is not performed.
|-
| 1 || A gaussian broadening function with a width specified by {{TAG|PHON_SIGMA}} is used.
|-
| 2 || The tetrahedron method is used.
|}

To get a representative density of states the {{FILE|QPOINTS}} file should specify a regular mesh.
When line mode in the {{FILE|QPOINTS}} file and gaussian smearing (PHON_DOS=1) is used, the phonon density of states will still be computed but the results are not reliable.
