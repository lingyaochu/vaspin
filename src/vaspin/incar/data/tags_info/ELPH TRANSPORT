Description: Activates transport calculation involving electron-phonon coupling
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

When {{TAGO|ELPH_TRANSPORT|True}}, VASP calculates the transport coefficients from the linearized Boltzmann transport equation.
In this framework, the transport coefficients are calculated from various relaxation-time approximations selectable via {{TAG|ELPH_SCATTERING_APPROX}}.
A convenient way to start transport calculations is to set {{TAGO|ELPH_MODE|transport}}, which automatically provides reasonable default values for the required {{FILE|INCAR}} tags.
