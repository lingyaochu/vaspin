{{TAGDEF|IFC_ASR|[integer]|1}}

Description: If positive, enforces the acoustic sum rule on the interatomic force constants during an electron-phonon calculation.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

The matrix of interatomic force constants (IFC) should obey the so-called acoustic sum rule (ASR).
However, due to numerical inaccuracies, it is possible that the ASR is slightly broken in practice.
In such cases, the phonons obtained from the [[Computing_the_phonon_dispersion_and_DOS|Fourier interpolation of the IFC matrix]] can become imaginary.

By setting {{TAGO|IFC_ASR|0|op=>}}, the ASR is explicitly enforced on the IFC matrix via an iterative scheme.
The number of iterations is also given by {{TAG|IFC_ASR}}.
{{NB|mind|{{TAGO|IFC_ASR|-2}} has a special meaning. Usually, the IFC matrix is forced to be symmetric. However, if {{TAGO|IFC_ASR|-2}}, then the IFC matrix is neither forced to be symmetric nor is the ASR applied. We do not recommend to use this setting.}}
