{{TAGDEF|EDIFFG|[real]|{{TAG|EDIFF}}&times;10}}

Description: {{TAG|EDIFFG}} defines the break condition for the ionic relaxation loop.
----
When {{TAG|EDIFFG}} is positive, the relaxation is stopped when the change of the total energy is smaller than {{TAG|EDIFFG}} between two ionic steps.

When {{TAG|EDIFFG}} is negative, the relaxation is stopped when the norms of all the forces are smaller than |{{TAG|EDIFFG}}|. This is usually a more convenient setting.

If {{TAG|EDIFFG}} = 0, the ionic relaxation is stopped after {{TAG|NSW}} steps.
{{NB|warning|{{TAG|EDIFFG}} does not apply to [[:Category:Molecular dynamics|molecular-dynamics]] simulations.}}
