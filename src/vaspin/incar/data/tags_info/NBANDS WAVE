Description: {{TAG|NBANDS_WAVE}} specifies the number of bands written to {{FILE|WAVECAR}} in the all-in-one mode of [[Many-body_perturbation_theory|many-body perturbation theory]] calculations,
i.e.,  {{TAG|ALGO}}=[[ACFDT/RPA_calculations|ACFDT[R]]], [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations|[EV]GW0[R]]], [[Practical_guide_to_GW_calculations#Fully_self-consistent_GW_caluclations:_GWR|GWR]].
{{NB|mind|available as of VASP.6.4.0}}
----
In the all-in-one mode, VASP automatically performs the necessary DFT steps prior to the many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculation, i.e. a DFT calculation with {{TAG|NBANDS}}, followed by an exact diagonalization of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian with {{TAG|NBANDSEXACT}} bands.
Note, {{TAG|NBANDSEXACT}} is set by default to the maximum number of plane-waves given by the chosen energy cutoff for the orbitals {{TAG|ENCUT}}.
In the all-in-one mode, the actual GW/RPA calculation is also performed with {{TAG|NBANDSEXACT}} bands.
If {{TAG|NBANDS_WAVE}} is not set, all orbitals are written to {{FILE|WAVECAR}}, which potentially becomes huge in file size.
{{NB|tip|The {{TAG|NBANDS_WAVE}} tag can be used to limit the number of bands written to {{FILE|WAVECAR}} if {{TAG|LALL_IN_ONE}}{{=}}.TRUE.|:}}

The all-in-one mode is automatically enabled for {{TAG|ALGO}}=[EV]GW[0]R, RPA[R],ACFDT[R] if {{TAG|NBANDS}} is not set.
