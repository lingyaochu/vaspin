{{TAGDEF|LMIXTAU|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE.|.FALSE.}}

Description: send the kinetic-energy density through the [[Density mixing|density mixer]] as well.
----
In many cases, the [[Density mixing|density-mixing scheme]] works well enough without passing the kinetic-energy density through the mixer. Therefore VASP uses {{TAG|LMIXTAU}}=.FALSE. per default. However, when the self-consistency cycle fails to converge for one of the algorithms exploiting [[Density mixing|density mixing]], e.g, {{TAG|IALGO}}=38 or 48, we recommend setting {{TAG|LMIXTAU}}=.TRUE..
