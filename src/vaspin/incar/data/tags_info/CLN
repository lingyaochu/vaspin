{{TAGDEF|CLN|[integer]}}
{{DEF|CLN| 1 | }}

Description: {{TAG|CLN}} selects the main quantum number <math>n</math> of the excited core electron when using {{TAG|ICORELEVEL}}>0.
----
{{NB|mind|Currently the spin-orbit coupling is only supported in the valence and conduction states but not in the core states. Hence, the splitting of an absorption edge with the orbital quantum number L>0 is not captured. For example, the splitting to ''L2'' and ''L3''-edges is not captured in the calculations and instead, a single ''L''-edge is shown.}}
