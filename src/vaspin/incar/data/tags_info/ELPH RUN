{{TAGDEF|ELPH_RUN|[logical]|.false.}}

Description: Select whether to run and electron-phonon calculation.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
This flag determined whether an electron-phonon calculation should be performed.
The most fundamental quantity we compute are the electron-phonon matrix elements.

These can simply be written to file when {{TAGO|ELPH_DRIVER|MELS}} for further post-processing.
Additionally, one can directly use these matrix elements to compute the electron self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling {{TAGO|ELPH_DRIVER|EL}}.
The self-energy can in turn be used to compute the [[Bandgap_renormalization_due_to_electron-phonon_coupling|renormalization of the electronic bandstructure]] or [[Transport_coefficients_including_electron-phonon_scattering|transport coefficients involving electron-phonon scattering]].

Additionally, the tag {{TAG|ELPH_MODE}} sets defaults for other {{FILE|INCAR}} tags depending on the quantities of interest.
