Description: This tag controls the criterion for "enforced" DFT calculations within the machine learning force field method.
----
The usage of this tag in combination with the learning algorithms is described here: [[Machine learning force field calculations: Basics#Sampling of training data and local reference configurations|here]].

If at any time, the estimated force errors are {{TAG|ML_CDOUB}} times larger than the Bayesian threshold (i.e. "critically" high), a first principles calculation is performed and a new force field is immediately generated (even if the counter for sampling is below the minimum amount of sampled structures {{TAG|ML_NMDINT}}).
