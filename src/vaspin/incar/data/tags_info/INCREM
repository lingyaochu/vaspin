{{TAGDEF|INCREM|[real array]|0}}

Description: {{TAG|INCREM}} controls the transformation velocity in the slow-growth approach (in case VASP was compiled with [[Precompiler options#-Dtbdyn|-Dtbdyn]]).
----
In [[Slow-growth_approach|slow-growth simulations]] ({{TAG|MDALGO}}=1 {{!}} 2), the value of each controlled geometric parameter with <tt>STATUS=0</tt> is increased by {{TAG|INCREM}} in every simulation step.

It must be supplied for each controlled geometric parameter for which <tt>STATUS=0</tt> was specified in the {{FILE|ICONST}}-file.
