{{TAGDEF|WC|[real]|1000.}}

Description: {{TAG|WC}} specifies the weight factor for each step in Broyden mixing scheme ({{TAG|IMIX}}=4).
----
*{{TAG|WC}}>0
:Set all weights identical to {{TAG|WC}} (resulting in Pulay's mixing method), up to now Pulay's scheme was always superior to Broyden's 2<sup>nd</sup> method.

*{{TAG|WC}}=0
:Switch to Broyden's 2<sup>nd</sup> method, i.e., set the weight for the last step equal to 1000 and all other weights equal to 0.

*{{TAG|WC}}<0 (implemented for test purposes: '''not''' recommended)
:Try some automatic setting of the weights according to:
::<math>W_{\rm iter}=0.01 |{\rm WC}|/||\rho_{\rm out}-\rho_{\rm in}||_{\rm precond.}\,</math>

:in order to set small weights for the first steps and increase weights for the last steps.
