{{DISPLAYTITLE:NCORE_IN_IMAGE1}}{{TAGDEF|NCORE_IN_IMAGE1|[integer]|0}}

Description: This tag specifies the number of cores in the first image.

----

This tag works for two images, specifically, if {{TAG|VCAIMAGES}} is set (this also sets {{TAG|IMAGES}}=2).
{{TAG|VCAIMAGES}} splits the available cores into two groups both working independently in the subdirectories
01 and 02.
The tag {{TAG|NCORE_IN_IMAGE1}} defines how many of cores are used for the first image (01). The remainder of the cores is used for the second image (working in the subdirectory 02).
