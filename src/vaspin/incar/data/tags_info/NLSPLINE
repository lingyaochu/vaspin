{{TAGDEF|NLSPLINE|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .FALSE.}}

Description: construct the PAW projectors in reciprocal space using spline interpolation so that they are ''k''-differentiable.
----
For {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE., the PAW projectors in reciprocal space ({{TAG|LREAL}}=.FALSE.) are set up using a spline interpolation so that they are ''k'' differentiable. This improves the susceptibility contribution to the chemical shifts. It only slightly affects the other contributions to the chemical shifts.

It is advised to set {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE. if and only if PAW projectors are applied in reciprocal space and chemical shifts are calculated, i.e., if and only if {{TAG|LREAL}}=.FALSE. and {{TAG|LCHIMAG}}=.TRUE. As this option also gives slightly different total energies, it is advised to use the default {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.FALSE. in all other calculations for reasons of compatibility.

Real-space projectors are ''k'' differentiable by construction, hence do not require to set {{TAG|NLSPLINE}}=.TRUE.
