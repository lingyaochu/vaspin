Description: Complex imaginary shift to use when computing the self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
If the value is set to 0.0 then the tetrahedron method is used to perform the Brillouin zone integrals and evaluate only the imaginary part of the electron self-energy. This is the recommended option for [[Transport coefficients including electron-phonon scattering|transport calculations]].

For [[Bandgap renormalization due to electron-phonon coupling| bandgap renormalization]] since one is mainly interested in the real part of the self-energy due to electron-phonon coupling, a small finite value should be used and a dense <b>k</b> point mesh used.

If more than one value is specified, the number of self-energy accumulators is increased such that one exists for each value in this array.
It is possible to compute the self-energy using the tetrahedron method and a finite complex shift in the same run.
