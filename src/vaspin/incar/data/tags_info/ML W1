{{DISPLAYTITLE:ML_W1}}
{{TAGDEF|ML_W1|[real]|0.1}}

Description: This tag defines the weight <math>\beta</math> for the radial (and angular) descriptor within the machine learning force field method (see [[Machine learning force field: Theory#Potential energy fitting|this section]]).
----
The weight for the angular descriptor <math>W_{2}</math> is internally computed from the weight of the radial descriptor <math>W_{1}</math> as:

<math>W_{2}=1.0-W_{1}.</math>

The value for {{TAG|ML_W1}} must be chosen in the interval <math>[0, 1]</math>.

By default, the angular and radial descriptors are both used although the latter is weighed less. In principle a weight of 0 for one of them is selectable which allows the code to internally skip the respective computation. However, it is generally recommended to use both descriptors to achieve satisfying training results.
