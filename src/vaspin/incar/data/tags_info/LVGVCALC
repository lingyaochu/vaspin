{{TAGDEF|LVGVCALC|.TRUE. {{!}} .FALSE. | .TRUE.}}

Description: {{TAG|LVGVCALC}} switches on calculation of the ''vGv'' expression for the orbital magnetic susceptibility.

{{TAG|LVGVCALC}} is available as of VASP.6.4.0.
----
When performing a chemical shift calculation the standard ''pGv'' susceptibility is calculated and used in the calculation of the CSA tensor {{Cite|yates:prb:2007}}. When {{TAG|LVGVCALC}} is true, the magnetic susceptibility is also calculated with the ''vGv'' approximation. {{TAG|LVGVAPPL}} determines whether the ''vGv'' or ''pGv'' result is applied in the calculation of the <math>\mathbf{G=0}</math> contribution to the CSA tensor.

The ''vGv'' expression for the orbital susceptibility was introduced by d'Avezac ''et al.'' {{Cite|avezac:prb:2007}}.
In VASP its ultra-soft generalization is used {{Cite|dewijs:havenith:jcp:2021}}.
