{{TAGDEF|FERDO|[real array]}}

Description: {{TAG|FERDO}} sets the occupancies of the states in the down-spin channel for {{TAG|ISMEAR}}=-2 and {{TAG|ISPIN}}=2.
----
To set the occupancies, specify
  {{TAG|FERDO}} = f(1) f(2) f(3) ... f({{TAG|NBANDS}}&times;N<sub>'''k'''</sub>)
The occupancies must be specified for all bands and k points. The band-index runs fastest. The occupancies must be between 0 and 1.
