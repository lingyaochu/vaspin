{{TAGDEF|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DRIVER|[integer]|{{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DRIVER}}}}

Description: choose method to compute the Onsager coefficients, which are then used to compute the transport coefficients.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
The transport coefficients can be computed using either of the options bellow, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

; {{TAGO|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DRIVER|1|op==}}
: Use a linear grid of energies with {{TAG|TRANSPORT_NEDOS}} in the interval determined by {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DFERMI_TOL}} or {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMIN}} and {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMAX}} and the Simpson integration rule to evaluate the Onsager coefficients.

; {{TAGO|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DRIVER|2|op==}}
: Use Gauss-Legendre integration to evaluate the Onsager coefficients. The convergence of the integral can be checked by performing a convergence study with respect to {{TAG|TRANSPORT_NEDOS}} alone.
