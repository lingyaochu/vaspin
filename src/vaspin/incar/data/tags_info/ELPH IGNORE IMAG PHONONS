{{TAGDEF|ELPH_IGNORE_IMAG_PHONONS|[logical]|.FALSE.}}

Description: If enabled, VASP ignores imaginary phonon frequencies during electron-phonon calculations.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----

Imaginary phonon frequencies are often a sign that the system in question is not well-converged or not well-described by the simulation.
In this case, the system should first be properly converged until stable (real) phonons are obtained.
{{NB|mind|Imaginary phonon frequencies can also appear at phase transitions or other lattice instabilities. However, for [[Electron-phonon_potential_from_supercells|perturbative electron-phonon calculations]], you should always choose a stable equilibrium structure.}}

If imaginary phonon frequencies are encountered during an electron-phonon calculation, VASP simply stops.
If {{TAGO|ELPH_IGNORE_IMAG_PHONONS|True}}, VASP instead skips the q-points at which the phonon frequencies are imaginary.
This can be useful since even a stable system can sometimes exhibit small imaginary phonon frequencies around the <math>\Gamma</math>-point due to numerical inaccuracies.
