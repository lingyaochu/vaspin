{{TAGDEF|NKRED|[integer]|1}}

Description: {{TAG|NKRED}} specifies an uniform reduction factor for the '''q'''-point grid representation of the exact exchange potential and the correlation part in GW calculations.
----
One may restrict the sum over '''q''' in the [[Hybrid functionals: formalism|Fock exchange potential]] (or one of its short range counterparts) to a subset, {'''q'''<sub>'''k'''</sub>}, of the full (''N''<sub>1</sub>&times;''N''<sub>2</sub>&times;''N''<sub>3</sub>)  '''k'''-point set, {'''k'''}, for which the following holds

:<math>
\mathbf{q_k} = \mathbf{b}_1 \frac{n_1 C_1}{N_1} + \mathbf{b}_2 \frac{n_2 C_2}{N_2}
+ \mathbf{b}_3 \frac{n_3 C_3}{N_3},\quad(n_i=0,..,N_i-1)
</math>

where '''b'''<sub>1,2,3</sub> are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the primitive cell,
and ''C''<sub>i</sub> is the integer grid reduction factor along reciprocal lattice direction
'''b'''<sub>i</sub>. This leads to a reduction in the computational workload by a factor:

:<math>
\frac{1}{C_1 C_2 C_3}
</math>

In case one sets {{TAG|NKRED}}, the grid reduction factors will be uniformly set to ''C''<sub>1</sub>=''C''<sub>2</sub>=''C''<sub>3</sub>={{TAG|NKRED}}. If one wants to specify separate grid reduction factors for ''C''<sub>1</sub>, ''C''<sub>2</sub>, and ''C''<sub>3</sub> one should use ''C''<sub>1</sub>={{TAG|NKREDX}}, ''C''<sub>2</sub>={{TAG|NKREDY}}, and ''C''<sub>3</sub>={{TAG|NKREDZ}}, respectively.

This flag also applies to GW and RPA calculations with a similar speedup. In GW and RPA type calculations,
analogously to hybrid functional calculations the outermost loop over the momentum transfer '''q'''
is reduced to a subgrid specified by the {{TAG|NKRED}} parameters.
