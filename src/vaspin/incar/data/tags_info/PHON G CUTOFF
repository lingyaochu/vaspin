Description: {{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}} sets the cutoff radius in reciprocal space used to determine the number of <math>\mathbf{G}</math> vectors involved in the Ewald sum in polar phonon calculations.
----

The Ewald sum that accounts for the long-range electrostatic interactions in phonon calculations runs over all G-vectors inside a cutoff sphere.
The radius of this sphere is given by {{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}} as a multiple of the longest reciprocal lattice vector of the primitive cell (as detected by VASP).
Specifying the cutoff this way (as opposed to an absolute length or energy) ensures a default value that is relatively system-independent.

The default value of {{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}} is a safe choice in most cases.
Lowering {{TAG|PHON_G_CUTOFF}} can result in faster phonon calculations.
However, ensure that the phonon spectrum is properly converged.
If you run into convergence problems, try raising the value until the phonon dispersion converges.
