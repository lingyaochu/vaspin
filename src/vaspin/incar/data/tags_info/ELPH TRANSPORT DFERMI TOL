{{TAGDEF|ELPH_TRANSPORT_DFERMI_TOL|[real]|1e-6}}

Description: choose the percentage of the integral of the derivative of the Fermi-dirac distribution with respect to the energy that is excluded from the integral that yields the Onsager coefficients.
{{Available|6.5.0}}

----
Using this parameter, the values of {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMIN}} and {{TAG|ELPH_TRANSPORT_EMAX}} are automatically computed based on the list of chemical potential and the integral of the derivative of the Fermi-dirac distribution.
This allows having a material independent parameter that is used to determine the energy window for which the electronic lifetimes must be computed.

A small value means that only the tails of the derivative of the Fermi-dirac distribution are excluded from the integral.
A large value means that only a small energy window around the chemical potential is used.

The number of energy points is determined by {{TAG|TRANSPORT_NEDOS}}.
