NCORE = 8  # Determines the number of compute cores that work on an individual orbital
NSIM = 16  # Sets the number of bands that are optimized simultaneously by the RMM-DIIS algorithm
PREC = Normal  # Specifies the 'precision' mode
ISTART = 1  # Determines whether or not to read the WAVECAR file.
ISPIN = 2  # Specifies spin polarization
NUPDOWN = 2  # Sets the difference between the number of electrons in the up and down spin components.
NELECT = 2046  # sets the number of electrons
ENCUT = 520  # specifies the energy cutoff for the plane-wave basis set in eV.
GGA = PS  # Selects a LDA or GGA exchange-correlation functional.
ISMEAR = 0  # determines how the partial occupancies fnk are set for each orbital.
SIGMA = 0.05  # Specifies the width of the smearing in eV.
EDIFF = 1e-06  # specifies the global break condition for the electronic SC-loop. EDIFF is specified in units of eV.
ISIF = 2  # Determines if the stress tensor is calculated and which ionic degrees of freedom are varied.
EDIFFG = -0.01  # defines the break condition for the ionic relaxation loop.
NSW = 20  # Sets the maximum number of ionic steps
IBRION = 2  # determines how the crystal structure changes during the calculation:
POTIM = 0.3  # Sets the time step in molecular dynamics or the step width in ionic relaxations.
LDMATRIX = False  # Computes the zero-field splitting (ZFS) matrix.
LWAVE = True  # Determines whether the wavefunctions are written to the WAVECAR file at the end of a run.
